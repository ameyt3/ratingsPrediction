0,5,"Hey everyone
After reading all reviews I have purchased this laptop.
Received it today early morning. It took 3 hours to start and then I took help of HP Support system and the issue was resolved within 5 mins. So go for it. Display and sound it too good as per me. Highly recommended for students."
1,5,"It is a great laptop for office work, specifically for beginners. It comes with Windows 10 and MS Office for 1 year and it is very easy to register the software through Microsoft Account. Although the Storage is only 256GB but it is enough for normal document storage. Besides 256GB SSD along with 8GB Ram makes it a faster device to operate. It boots quickly and the inbuilt speakers are loud enough. It is a small size and light weight laptop. It is easy to carry and budget friendly. One cannot..."
2,5,Nice product suitable for any type of working and not too short works fast
3,5,if you search laptop for kids and also for office work within your limited budget this is your best choice.Thanks for flipkart for provide me with in time period in the pandemic situation. easy for installation and easy for do all activity if you little know about laptop.
4,4,The biggest use case for a laptop is probably as a portable workstation they can be carried to office or to college. This laptop has to be powerful enough to get work done fast. It should be a device with a healthy battery back up and at the same time not too bulky. And it helps immensely if it‚Äôs easy on the wallet. HP‚Äôs new laptop called HP 14s is a product that tries to condense all the above-mentioned requirements . I am very happy.
5,3,"This is a good laptop. I'm happy with it. Since SSD harddrive and 8GB RAM have been installed, the performance of the system is quite good. Thank you Flipkart for delivering on time."
6,5,"Using for the last two weeks, at this price point a good option. About the unit, the performance is very good since it has SSD storage. For online classes and for minor office works it will be useful. No major cons... No doubt!!! Go for itüëç"

Nice back-lit for use at night and as well very smooth working finger print. Over all nice laptop please buy."
13,1,"Wifi connection is not working properly hardware issue, also i m experiencing differences in performance compare to top laptop brands like dell, asus, hp lenovo, it feels like avita is a boy laptop not for professionals"
14,5,"Awesome performance, better than the i5 version. Design wise it is as comfortable as MacBook"
15,5,"Awesome laptop in this price range at 30k... Ryzen processor is best as compared to intel or any other...guys Dont think, go ahead with it... I really love it"
16,3,"Good at the price point, however it heats and fan noise is significant under minimal usage, please buy if and only if you are fine with that....as well speaker is average or below average. Performance won't be an issue , untill and unless you are doing something real heavy"
17,5,"Happy to have trusted Avita and Flipkart! From the specs perspective, this is just the config I need, also the price was well within my budget. If I had waited a few more days, I could've got it cheaper by another 2k on Flipkart though. No complaints whatsoever."
18,5,Oh My God! This is awsooooomeü§òü§òü§ò i am loving it.. Super... fastes laptop in this price range. Battery is need to be improve overall it's just woow... Thank u flipkart for such a cool laptop at cheap price..

20,3,"Writing after a week of usage
Positives:
Light and lavish design
Display is very good
Performance is great at this price bracket
Sound is decent not as bad as everyone saying
Negatives:
Battery is very bad melting like ice in desert
If you use lightly it can sustain for 3 hours
Heavy use not even 2 hours
Conclusion:
Not recommended for heavy users
Light users can go for it without any thoughts
PDFs, browsing, videos etc"
21,5,Battery stand by upto 3 to 4 hours it is good . Design is too compact not so lighter but is good only for rs 29990 ....
22,4,"This is a NICE LAPTOP.
It comes with i3 10th gen which is obviously not for gaming. In terms of performance on the basic usage, it's up to the mark!! It has good frequency 8gb ram so it feels 2 times smoother. If we talk about battery then it's just like 1.5 year old laptop, I mean it has low battery backup just like 1.5 year to 2 year old laptop. It runs 2-3 hrs on battery while reading and browsing. And it don't charge upto 100% due to windows feature of over charging prevention. It charge ..."
23,4,"A budget laptop. 8GB RAM makes it a little bit faster. Decent display, lightweight (easy to carry) and preloaded windows 10 operating system are some of its highlights at its budget price range. It is useful for net surfing, for online classes, watching movies etc. However it is not for gaming as it does not have a graphics card. Sound is not up to the mark. Camera quality is low. To sum it up, it's a good laptop for normal day to day use considering its budget price range."
24,2,"The specification on paper is very impressive, but in reality it is not so. System is Very slow. Performance is not good. Battery is draining fast. It is really a cheat and spoil lenovo reputations. Not advisable product."
25,5,Awesome
26,1,"Product review: I bought this laptop as I've used Lenovo laptops before but the quality of this laptop is just horrible. I'm really disappointed with its sound system . If someone is speaking in the same room and at same time you're watching video on this laptop you can not hear audio on laptop. Here it's described that product has Dolby sound system but it is a marketing agenda. Do not buy this product.
Flipkart service review: As I received the product I asked for return within 24 hours but..."
27,3,"I got the laptop yesterday.
Battery is not lasting more than 3 hour.
Sound is not so low.
Camera is not working properly.
Sometime laptop is acting very slow.
Overall good product in this price"
28,1,Don't waste your money for this laptop
29,4,Battery backup is major issue.
30,5,"It's a good laptop with no issue as such ! Screen is IPS good viewing angles ! Battery is decent 4-5hr easily!
Build quality is good previously i was using HP 14s i3 11th gen, the quality was poor, though it is a good laptop when it comes to performance.
The only issue is it's VRAM which is 512mb quite low !! You can't play GTA V in even 720p, which is possible in i3 11th gen which can play it in 1080p.
Rest it's a good piece of hardware."
31,4,Looks is fine... Easy to carry! But can't play a normal 4k video from pendrive and there is no antiglare display. So in sunlight or in normal bright light you might face some issues. Otherwise it's a good choice.
32,4,"I wanted a backup system (to work during thunderstorm) for work and didn't want to spend much. I got it for 39000 without any offers but still satisfied with my purchase. The processor, ram and ssd combination is good enough for web development. I didn't face any lag while coding in vs code. Used photoshop and illustrator as well. Display is too good. Built with plastic but still seems steady."
33,5,"It has been 20 days i am using this laptop , no doubt it is a good laptop with decent performance and good battery life of 6 -7hours. But i have noticed few cons
1- It's design is good ,it is sleek but still it is not so sturdy , i find it delicate and should be handled with care.
2- It has only two USB slots sometimes this becomes a big problem.
3- Although it has full hd screen but it is very reflective in low Brightness you can see your face and things in background. I don't understand wh..."
34,4,"Pros:
1. Display is really good.
2. It's compact and Lightweight
3. It's better for Programming and development work in this price range (37 K)
4. Multitasking is good and smooth.
5. Booting start within 4-6 sec.
6. Restart within 12-18 sec.
7. Genuine Windows with Microsoft Office
8. Battery back-up is descent
9. Perfect for student

Cons:
1. Fan position is very bad. Display get warm by hot air flow (Who's the architect???)
2. Camera quality is not so good
3. Voice recording is also little..."
35,5,One of the best value laptops out there in the budget range. Possibly an entry level gaming laptop which can play a good game at the normal or low settings perhaps with an additional 8gb Ram. I took it for home use and for kids for their online classes. It has not failed me and quite happy with the deal.
36,5,This is good one in this price range. You can buy it. Look is classy and having good configuration. Easy to use and robust design.
37,4,"The following cons and pros are keeping the price bracket in mind.

Cons:
1) Build quality is pretty poor. Feels like a toy.
2) Keyboard is horrible. It's not a pleasant experience typing
on this.
3) Trackpad feels cheaper than the price paid.

Pros:
1) App loading times and boot times are snappy with the
SSD.
2) Performance is solid
3) Sound quality is decent.
4) Display has decent brightness.

Overall good for 1st time users but if you have used a half decent ..."
38,4,"Nice product , cool design and killer look . Processor Speed sufficient and the more can say that satisfied of all respects"
39,4,"Nice laptop in this price range, satisfied with its performance but one thing is missing.
There is no backlit keyboard."
40,4,"Excellent value for the price.
So the laptop arrived after 3 days and was inside 3 boxes. Coming to the review:
8GB ram is a bit less, should definitely upgrade to 16GB. However, it has warranty sticker om top of one of the screws, so I don't know if you can upgrade it yourself. Acer service center will charge you 8k for the ram upgrade (P.S. - I personally went there and checked).
Coming to the laptop the hinges of the laptop rotate 180¬∞, but are on the lose side if you compare it with other..."
41,5,"A really value for money purchase imo. Tried Shadow of Tomb Raider - got 60 fps at medium high.
Some pointers regarding the product:
1- it does not have a finger print sensor as it's 1650 counterpart
2- you may claim free games from Intel by googling ""softwareoffers Intel"" (this keeps changing regularly, currently cuphead, Cyclist, world of worships and Gear Tactics along with Trial version of Origin pass is being provided)
3- Download Geforce Experince from Nvidia's site for better optimisa..."

43,4,Acer aspire 7 is one of the best gaming laptop with affordable cost when compared with other gaming laptops GTA 5 goes butterly smooth without any lag you can play it with 1080 resolution. Screen of the laptop is Full HD display and it's awesome .Battery of the laptop is 4hrs with full brightness and with online .

The overall build quality is great, though it looks simple it is a beast in performance.
I have been using this laptop from past 20 days and have observed-
1. The display screen has a yellow tinge, but it's not a problem

2. The sound is a bit low.

Some people says that Cooling system and speakers are bad. But i don‚Äôt think so.. That‚Äôs the best laptop in this budget.

FHD IPS display is great

Fast as hell

I got 432Gb free to use

48,5,"I purchased this laptop on 18 February 2021, got delivered by 23 February 2021. Had to pick the laptop myself from the EKART hub, since delivery person couldn't take laptop for delivery.

Make sure to make a video while unboxing, so in case any damages to the product, you get easy replacement.

I unboxed, and alas, it was so beautiful. Make sure to check all the ports, usbs, any scratches or fingerprints. Now you may end the video making.

49,5,"Amazing laptop having every required features ...cool design,backlit keyboard,8gb ram ,sufficient rom, really good cooling system and smooth response...for sure perfect for gaming and also for other non gaming works....maximum features in reasonable price ...a little heavy ...but as a gaming laptop this is not a big issue...go for it...and try to buy it in sale"
50,4,"Very decent configuration on paper. Fairly decent to work with too.
My points of contention -
a. Loaded with tons of 'bloatware' - from HP, Microsoft etc.
b. Flimsy construction - especially the keyboard
c. Flimsier trackpad - absence of the left & right-click buttons, makes the trackpad an all-in-one piece of plastic which rattles on extended use. I'd suggest the use of an external mouse, right from the start

So, for 44K it's a good buy. Especially for WFH challenges and for online classes."
51,5,"Good product. Delivered 2 days in advance of originally committed date. Very good packaging. Appreciate the service. Product is good as specified, light weight, screen is bright and attractive."

66,2,"I PURCHASED LAPTOP 1 MONTH BACK AND NOW I AM FACING BATTERY/SOME HARDWARE ISSUE. LAPTOP BATTERY IS NOT CHARGING. I LOCKED CASE WITH ACER SUPPORT BUT NO PROPER RESPONSE, GENERIC STATEMENTS, I AM WAITING SINCE 8 DAYS AND STILL NO ONE ATTENDED THE TROUBLE SHOOTING CALL, NO LINK FOR CASE TRACKING, I AM COMPLETELY UNAWARE ABOUT MY CASE STATUS.

67,4,"Laptop is good at 8gb ram. After I've upgraded it to 16gb. It's working absolutely Great.
I play PUBG on Smooth Extreme and it's totally smooth.
I've tried HD and Extreme and it works fine but heats so i orefer smooth and Extreme.
Upgrade Ram to 16gb and It'll be very fast.
Btw it boots within 10seconds."

69,5,"My first impression and One day full usage.
1. The very fist thing i was impressed was the Design and build quality. Very very satisfying design The surface are smooth matte finished. Very hardly fingerprints would pickup. Though the material is plastic, you would never feel bad.
2. The hinge was very thin and of good quality. You can lift it off with one finger. You can flex your hinge to flat upto 180degree.
3. Display, I think this is one of the best display for this budget. FHD anti g..."
70,4,"Best laptop for this price range. Good for both programming and gaming. Also it arrived before the estimated date which is really goodüëçüëçüëçüëç

Edit(after 3 days of use) - Battery not that good. If i keep the laptop open from 100%battery...it gets upto 80% within 10 mins. Also I was using VS Code and the battery drained from 100% to 40% in battery saver mode within 1 hour. OVERALL THIS LAPTOP IS A BEAST FOR THIS RANGE."
71,5,"Very good performance laptops this range. Fast charging, display so good, overall quality wise good. Very fast booting and shutting down."
72,5,Its just fab best budget friendly gaming laptop it works so smooth
73,4,If you want a lowest budget gaming laptop then i would recommend this one as i got it in 45000 during big billion sale. If you are a gamer & want a lowest budget laptop with high specs then go for it but if your budget is good then you should go for other laptops. The working is perfect but when i purchased this one around a month my laptop adapter gone down & it took a week for a new one.
74,5,"Looks surprisingly sleek for an entry level gaming laptop so it can be easily carried into professional environment as it doesn't have that flashy gamer body design but packs a punch under the hood. I'm very impressed by what this device is capable of. I've bought this mainly for college work and the GTX 1650 graphics card really enabled this machine to game as well as perform college tasks. The display isn't the greatest but for the price you're paying for this hardware, it's quite acceptabl..."
75,4,"If you are looking for a laptop for graphic intensive tasks like video editing , photoshop , playing heavy games then this is the best you can get under 50k for sure. Because this laptop has 6gb ram for graphics alone!

On the other hand if you want it for regular office work like browsing , streaming content , or making word and ppts then I would recommend you to go with an i3 laptop which will cost around 35k .

This thing is a beast and that's why it sucks that much juice. If you wont be u..."
76,4,"pros:
1. cooler boost keeps laptop reasonably cool.
2. display is nice
3. boot time and loading time is also great thanks to ssd

cons:
1. 8gb ram is not enough
2. out of 512gb you get around 380gb ssd although fast is not enough.
3. performance according to price is great but gtx 1650 in other laptops is better than 1650ti maxq
4. speaker is clear but has no base and is poorly positioned

If you want to buy this laptop be ready to shed more money on storage and ram"
77,4,"Honestly this is my first laptop
I think its good but not sure though
But with decent specs its the best in this price range with max q and ti
And it also comes with the 2 year warrenty
I think its decent for its price range and the best one to get i cant give you the full review yet but as far as i have used its fun
Thanks for the product"
78,3,"Good graphics performance but still You'll not feel it's 9th Gen I5 processer.
You'll feel lags in each task like opening windows explorer or editing videos.
Video rendering speed is very good but while editing it hangs so many times.
I have another Asus i5 processer without graphics but that's working like MAKHAN
Keyboard is also little different so it takes time to get used to it.
And yes you'll see it's heating more than normal when you're rendering videos or playing games"
79,5,"I am writing this review after 2 weeks.
Just go for blindly if you got it for around 60k ,

The i5 with GTX graphics card games gonna run smoothly
You can All games can play in 60fps according to your customisation
And modern games like valhalla ,days gone , resident above 50fps .
Webcam quality is ok.
Display quality is superb. And have less bezels.
If you experience any lag connect the charger and keep the battery in Windows at best performance mode and select extreme performance mode in..."
80,4,"Everything is perfect üòä
Just only issue is that it has only single fan yes it has heat pipe connected to both cpu and gpu but still single fan is not enough to cool this powerful beast
Maybe a cooling pad will help"
81,5,"Don't think twice just go for it...
Battery is OK don't expect good battery backup in gaming laptops.
Ssd Is fast and if you want to change from those core companies like dell and asus go for msi you will not regret it..
If you want second options go for asus tuf or Lenovo legion y540 but if you are getting this laptop under 57000 then go for it"
82,4,Everything is fine performance is good build quality is nice but major minus is track pad its not at all working even though i try shorcut keys its not working you have to order extrnal mouse.. Touchpad is not working (Even i press FN+F3)
83,4,"performance is super, üîã back up and display also good, design is ok, got the product in big billion day at reasonable price, first time tried MSI by ignoring HP as I listened recently from many, they said performance wise MSI is the best. Now experiencing it, everything is good till today. writing this review after 1 month, has to see how long it will work better. thank you"
84,4,"Very good gaming laptop in this price range. There is one issue I faced when I play heavy games, The laptop heats a lot. Otherwise doing daily works its not get heated.
I have searched the gaming laptops quiet sometime. But this laptop is more updated on the previous one. I would suggest who is looking for i5 processor in a gaming laptop just go for it. You really liked this beast..."
85,5,"Initially i work on this laptop 12 hours and after i play game like fifa nfs its cool still now around last 2 week's i used pretty much happy with the laptop,there ate few things i miss like msi should provide atlist one more usb port.. because if you used a lot of gadgets then surely you will feel shortage of usb others still now can't complains about the laptop"
86,5,"I am writing this review after 3 month using this laptop. This is the best laptop in this price range the performance was superb. Reboot time is just 5 to 7 seconds. 65 watt charger charge the laptop with in 60 to 70 minutes. There was no noise from the fan in any condition. And one thing is missing form the laptop is back light keyboard. If you use this laptop in the night you cab face problem. Otherwise laptop is superb by looks, built quality and performance.
And one more thing you can't p..."
87,5,"Laptop is really amazing for all kinds of users except gamers. What I didn't like about the laptop is the keyboard,it doesn't have a back lit keyboard and the buttons don't look that good. Overall performance is 10/10.
I really loved this laptop."
88,5,"Best laptop in this price range .performance wise it is good but they should have given lifetime office because this variant doesn't come with graphics.mi should think about this like I am not buying this for playing games if it doesn't have graphics.so consider giving office free.
Otherwise it is good .go for it if you dont play games."
89,5,"Laptop is good but it looks bit small compared to other laptops and on the laptop ther is no logo or a sticker or branding, so it looks bit less satisfaction (not even a single sticker except i5 10 th gen) they should atleast highlight the features. AND There r 2 types in mi notebook 14 (difference is graphics card Intel UHD nd other one is UHD 620) but the laptop I ordered is having 620 ,when I checked the details it only written as UHD so will check some more details nd update the review.

93,5,"First, i love it finishing, design and display. It is with fast performance coz ssd. Also sound quality is the best than others."
94,4,"Writing this review after using for close to 2 months.

No major complaints.

1. but if the laptop come with separate keys for Home, page up/down , pratical usage would have been easy.
2. Bezel for screen at top and bottom are more.

Pros:
1. Performance is good for day to day tasks for browsing, study and working on projects.
2. Battery comes for 7 to 9 hours depending on battery mode.
3. No heating issue
4. Body is not plastic and looks good."

100,4,It's good. If having decent budget go for this.
101,3,"As far as I m concern,the look and design is quite impressive. It is thin and light which really satisfied my desire, but it‚Äôs resolution is not good. After all it is really compact and cozy."
102,4,"The product is meeting expectations , but the display is rather bleak ,second thing is memory ram chipset . It is said the memory ram has frequency 2133 MHz ,but when start installing second memory chip I saw its Kingston 2666 MHz . Which is better then the description"
103,4,Best quality I love this
104,1,Worst product !
105,5,Everything is perfect except I can't connect my USB cable in USB port. When I connect the connection of cable is not stable.
106,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
107,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
108,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
109,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
110,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."

113,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment.
If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
114,5,"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...

Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ...Just download a software called driver booster which is free and a great soft indeed it scans for all available driver updates and installs them , also it has a game turbo power option which releases some ra..."
115,4,"Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it
1. The display is good
2. The Laptop runs smoothly
3. Upgradable which is a big pro
4. Great sound quality
5. beautiful build
6. Games work nicely
Cons
1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd
2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram

Overall i would really say this is a great laptop"
116,5,This is super fast laptop in the budget segment. Good for school and college work. Due to SSD the speed is very fast. Can easily play games. Screen is very good but not great. Handles most of the daily work with pleasurest ease. Not sure if this can be used for video editing...but I hv seen videos which says so!!
117,4,"Laptop is really great. Before buying I was in confusion between Ryzen and Intel. After 7 days of usage, I felt no difference. I continuously use my laptop for office and movies at least 10 hours a day and didn't e even notice any heating problem. If you are looking for a laptop below 45k with good performance, just go for it."

Pros:
Ryzen processor is top class and is super quick.
Build quality is top notch and it is quite stylish and has an elegant look.
Battery backup of this is second to none. U can use it for like 8-10 hours at full computing.
Fingerprint Scanner is quite good and not even once I faced any issue with that.
A lot of talk about display being poor but it is quite good and for normal use, it is quite sufficient and enough.

Till now it was, Apple was offering 7 at the price of 10, looks were alaways 10 out of 10 but now Apple is giving 15 at the price of 10.. Absolutely worth the price."
147,5,"At the current scenario where a proper Graphics card windows laptop is costing around 1.2 lakh at a min.
This MacBook Air M1 is the best deal and I got it around 82k so I received the best deal.
So we can now say Apple Laptop is cheaper in price than Windows."

Now for me it is totally okay."

If you need good battery backup then please don't go with it rather consider buying Asus. I don't understand how can they tell such big lies by claiming 6 hours battery backup. It only gives you 2.5-3 hours approx. back-up in normal usage.

You can go for either one as per your budget, later can be upgraded.
Great for day to day task for what I have purchased it.
Nevertheless, can play pubg pc lite at 60 fps- 50 fps at low settings.

211,4,"Tested this beaut on various AAA titles(RDR2, HZD, Apex etc.) on High settings(not ultra) giving 70+ fps throughout without thermal throttling.
Gaming mode is effective and keeps thermal down, although fan sound is a bit noticeable(With headset its okay).
The only con I felt about this laptop is the placement of speakers and cheap plastic used for bottom panel in comparison to top panel.
Would have been a steal deal if the exact variant is available without SteelSeries RBG keyboard as not all..."
212,4,"Pros:
1.Since it has RTX 2060, you don't have to worry about performance.
2. It has 7 heat pipes, 2 fans, 3 airflow vents and a external button for cooler boost fans which will dissipate the heat in 10 sec.
3. The display is great when you tweak with the contrast and colors in intel command center.
4. The battery life is fine when you use it to work or surf the internet (3-4 hrs).
5. The per-key RGB keyboard is astonishing aand allows you to customize it completely.

213,4,"I had some issues with the delivery but anyways, I've only used it for a while and so far performance is great. Specs are amazing for its price range. The color display is really good too and I love the per key rgb keyboard. But honestly the battery is pretty bad."
214,5,"The laptop was awesome and is suitable for high performance gaming. it has been 20 days since my purchase and it was excellent.the only concern is the battery life. I strongly suggest please use dedicated user modes in msi dragon centre for the best user experience .the percentage of battery decrease very drastically for games when gaming mode is not enabled
When using for productivity please choose super battery or custom mode.The graphics card with this laptop is very good I have tested ga..."
215,5,"First of all, MSI has been great with after sale service. I have asked many questions on their Instagram DM and they habe responded very quickly with the solutions. Second, the laptop feels like you have paid one and a quarter lakh for it. I am able to run Forza Horizon 4 at 144fps on Balanced mode. So the Extreme performance is rarely used for me. By this you can understand how much powerful it is. And the fan is very quiet in Balanced mode which is a plus point. Only issue is that the power..."

Performance is also not great some CAD files take too long to open
Poor asthetics and plastic build looks too shaby
Overall bad choice. I still repent buying this"

Well it's a gaming laptop but I have not yet played any games but I am a btech cse 1st year student...
So I must say all of my programming different apps like autocad,python,Vs code all works smoothly...
It has a very powerful graphic card which is a plus point...üåü
The best thing is it reached my house in just 3 days which is amazing!!!
I think you should go for it...üëç"
220,5,This laptop is so good at this price point. Specially design and performance. Battery is good for normal task and gaming it gives moderate backup. Still it supports fast charging and it's boot time is very fast. I would recommend this laptop instead of acer nitro

And its a beauty and beast combo for the price. Its very good for gaming as well as other works"

And one more thing you can't p..."
227,5,"Laptop is really amazing for all kinds of users except gamers. What I didn't like about the laptop is the keyboard,it doesn't have a back lit keyboard and the buttons don't look that good. Overall performance is 10/10.
I really loved this laptop."
228,5,"Best laptop in this price range .performance wise it is good but they should have given lifetime office because this variant doesn't come with graphics.mi should think about this like I am not buying this for playing games if it doesn't have graphics.so consider giving office free.
Otherwise it is good .go for it if you dont play games."
229,5,"Laptop is good but it looks bit small compared to other laptops and on the laptop ther is no logo or a sticker or branding, so it looks bit less satisfaction (not even a single sticker except i5 10 th gen) they should atleast highlight the features. AND There r 2 types in mi notebook 14 (difference is graphics card Intel UHD nd other one is UHD 620) but the laptop I ordered is having 620 ,when I checked the details it only written as UHD so will check some more details nd update the review.

234,4,"Writing this review after using for close to 2 months.

No major complaints.

1. but if the laptop come with separate keys for Home, page up/down , pratical usage would have been easy.
2. Bezel for screen at top and bottom are more.

Pros:
1. Performance is good for day to day tasks for browsing, study and working on projects.
2. Battery comes for 7 to 9 hours depending on battery mode.
3. No heating issue
4. Body is not plastic and looks good."

decent in performance is just due to nvmessd but that too is made by micron having read and write speed of 506 mbps which is equivalent or lesser than ssd‚Ä¶ current nvme like evo970 plus boasts about 1500mbps read/ write speeds. would not suggest anyone in buying this

Looks awesome with RGB Lightning
Beast for gaming
I'm playing valorant with 100-150 fps in medium level graphic settings
And also Battlefield 3 & Call of duty ww2
Also good for multi tasking with i5 10300h 2.50ghz
With rpm speed 2933Mhz which can be changed later to 3200 MHz
Integrated graphics is also awesome - Intel(R) UHD Graphics
I give 4.5 rating for this beast one at 61k"

Don't blindly compare specs only, what matters most is real ground performance. Hope you will make a good decision."
258,5,"The Asus ROG Strix G15 offers just enough performance to justify its 144Hz refresh rate.

In this price range display quality is best(144hz) and style and built is very good. Stylish looks due to the LEDs around it.
Battery backup isnt good.
Every AAA titles can give 50-60 fps at max settings and ofc smooth gameplay.

COOLING (Thermals) are nicely managed using it for 2 day..."
262,5,Beast!!! I have played Valorant And watch Dogs 2 at high settings. It maintains completely 144hz refresh rate. Battery Backup is sufficient. Can easily handle every game at at least 60fps. The Armoury Crate App is awesome. U can change modes and turbo boost your processor and GPU at higher frequencies. Overall Decent Product
263,5,"Initially bought it because there were no other laptops with 144hrz in this price range but with the introduction of nitro 5 with the same if not better specs and cheaper price. This shows less value for money. If you want rgb l, nitro 5 has it too. Only difference is the rgb on this is kinda unique with the bottom edges lit up. Else, other then that, performance wise as well, other machines can get better fps and the like."

Display: the display is good, there are a bunch of customisation you can do in Armory crate.
Keyboard and trackpad: the keyboard is good but could have been better. The track pad is..."
266,4,A very Modern Design for the year. The laptop is well equipped with designated hardware to cope up with the office needs. The design is all alluminium feel and built quality is sturdy. The screen is so far the best feature as it's in matte finish helping avoided background reflection. The sound quality from the laptop is decent in terms of the construction and catagory it falls in (slim and light). People expecting a home theatre like sound needs to understand this is a laptop and not a deskt...
267,5,Nice design and battery backup is too good......but in the case of sound quality I give 2/5 star rating ....bcz sound is not to loud...other wise this is a premium and value of money product 5/5 rating .....I recommend you all too....Thanks again flipkart....ü•∞

289,1,"Overheating issues. This laptop gets heated within 10 mins of usage, even when you are just browsing internet, and battery is also not meeting the expectations. You feel like battery has full charge, and all of a sudden it goes down by 10%. I feel as if I am using an old outdated laptop. Not at all comfortable with this overheating. Trust me, even my 10 years old Dell laptop was not overheating like this.
Performance and specifications are excellent."
290,4,Everything is working fine except bluetooth . Whenever i connect my bluetooth earphones and watch videos there is crackling and popping sound . I have used my earphones with my mobile phone and old pc and they work just fine. The issue must be in this new laptop. I have tried everything on software part but i did not find any solution.

I have tried running SOLR servers and working parrallel with tomcat servers running on eclipse and it works damn smooth.

Programmers don't hesitate until and unless you are looking out for ML and AI which eventually requires server with GPU only.

I upgraded the RAM to 16 GB for some additional tasks but even 8 GB is enough for ample coding stuff.

316,5,Best budget laptop with gtx1650ti to play heavy games with easy more than 60fps and with ssd it boots up within 4-5 secs. I play valorant and get 150fps easily with competitive settings. It's a great budget gaming laptop you won't be disappointed with it at this price

the speaker is a little underwhelming but that is the case with every laptop. I will recommend buying 2 years extended warranty via shopacer just for the peace of mind
buy this ryzen 5 version because its a 12nm processor and offers just a little extra battery life compared to the intel counterpart. overall a great purchase"
319,4,"Following Review is based on 35 days of recurrent use for Gaming and Other Complex computation purposes.
+After 2 months of patience and rigorous research for a budget laptop, I found this to be the only one packed with 4 Gigs VRAM, 8 Gigs of RAM which is easily the minimum requirement for most of the PC Games. And yes, Most of them run silky smooth with over 35 Fps on Medium to High Graphics Preset. I tired, Witcher 3, GTA5, Dyling Light, Just Cause 4, Watch Dogs 2 also simulators like Train..."
320,5,"Excellent product and definitely worth more than the price. Getting a GTX 1650 Ti in 4 GB graphics and many other features makes this a blinder to go for. I'm a college student and I use this for software simulation and E-learning purpose. I've been using this for a week now. The backlit keyboard ( which many of the competitors do not provide at this range) , 48Whr 3 cell battery with 135W fast charging adapter, ETHERNET jack, AMD Ryzen 5 3550H processor , 8 GB ram expandable upto 32 GB and ..."
321,5,"I was bit sceptical on purchase of this costly Laptop kind of electronic item online.but gave a shot and I must say the product arrived before the date given and packed properly.

The product was absolutely in perfect condition,and working. The seal wasn't broken and seller ensured every thing was intact in package as per the Laptop Company. Acer.

The laptop is great as I am using past one week.
The processor Ryzen5 , Nvidia 1650ti and a solid built laptop by acer and that too a reasonable p..."
322,5,"Awesome laptop. Price to performance

Pros:
1. Lightening fast performance in gaming and other tasks. Play older games from 2015 at ultra settings and new games on medium to high at 50-60fps.
2.backlight keyboard
3. Camera is good for video call

Cons:
1. Battery is not up to the mark
2. Sound is super low
3. Screen is not vibrant but good for this price

Note: please play games with charging on. DO NOT use laptop on bed or couch because it would resist airflow and will lead to hardware issues."
323,4,"Good laptop for average use .gaming not tested . available storage is only 415 out of 475gb,you have to buy external hard disk to store some information.buid quality is not much impressive but ok .over all good buying"
324,5,"Arrived on time. Packaging was good. With the ssd, average boot time is 4-5sec. Display is pretty well and gives at lest 100fps in max settings on games like Valorant. Really satisfied with the productüëçüèª"
325,5,"first of all very fast delivery by flipkart received in 2 days
amazing speed
Good design does not look like a heavy gaming laptop although it is a gaming laptop
Graphics 1650Ti is brilliant at this price point
boots in less than 5 seconds
white backlit keyboard is soothing
screen rotates 180‚ÑÉ"
326,5,"It's a good laptop with no issue as such ! Screen is IPS good viewing angles ! Battery is decent 4-5hr easily!
Build quality is good previously i was using HP 14s i3 11th gen, the quality was poor, though it is a good laptop when it comes to performance.
The only issue is it's VRAM which is 512mb quite low !! You can't play GTA V in even 720p, which is possible in i3 11th gen which can play it in 1080p.
Rest it's a good piece of hardware."
327,4,Looks is fine... Easy to carry! But can't play a normal 4k video from pendrive and there is no antiglare display. So in sunlight or in normal bright light you might face some issues. Otherwise it's a good choice.
328,4,"I wanted a backup system (to work during thunderstorm) for work and didn't want to spend much. I got it for 39000 without any offers but still satisfied with my purchase. The processor, ram and ssd combination is good enough for web development. I didn't face any lag while coding in vs code. Used photoshop and illustrator as well. Display is too good. Built with plastic but still seems steady."
329,5,"It has been 20 days i am using this laptop , no doubt it is a good laptop with decent performance and good battery life of 6 -7hours. But i have noticed few cons
1- It's design is good ,it is sleek but still it is not so sturdy , i find it delicate and should be handled with care.
2- It has only two USB slots sometimes this becomes a big problem.
3- Although it has full hd screen but it is very reflective in low Brightness you can see your face and things in background. I don't understand wh..."
330,4,"Pros:
1. Display is really good.
2. It's compact and Lightweight
3. It's better for Programming and development work in this price range (37 K)
4. Multitasking is good and smooth.
5. Booting start within 4-6 sec.
6. Restart within 12-18 sec.
7. Genuine Windows with Microsoft Office
8. Battery back-up is descent
9. Perfect for student

Cons:
1. Fan position is very bad. Display get warm by hot air flow (Who's the architect???)
2. Camera quality is not so good
3. Voice recording is also little..."
331,5,One of the best value laptops out there in the budget range. Possibly an entry level gaming laptop which can play a good game at the normal or low settings perhaps with an additional 8gb Ram. I took it for home use and for kids for their online classes. It has not failed me and quite happy with the deal.
332,5,This is good one in this price range. You can buy it. Look is classy and having good configuration. Easy to use and robust design.
333,4,"The following cons and pros are keeping the price bracket in mind.

Cons:
1) Build quality is pretty poor. Feels like a toy.
2) Keyboard is horrible. It's not a pleasant experience typing
on this.
3) Trackpad feels cheaper than the price paid.

Pros:
1) App loading times and boot times are snappy with the
SSD.
2) Performance is solid
3) Sound quality is decent.
4) Display has decent brightness.

Overall good for 1st time users but if you have used a half decent ..."
334,4,"Nice product , cool design and killer look . Processor Speed sufficient and the more can say that satisfied of all respects"
335,4,"Nice laptop in this price range, satisfied with its performance but one thing is missing.
There is no backlit keyboard."
336,5,"The laptop is a beast...can run all the AAA titles around high to very high, RTX 2060 is upto the mark.

In terms of video editing i7 10th gen along with graphic does a good job, rendered 8 min video in premiere pro in just around 1:30 min, and a composition about 40 sec in after effects took 18 min, which is a remarkable time limit I must say.

Delivery might be late a day or two because of the time of pandemic but product will reach you

REVIEWS AFTER 8 DAYS OF EXTREME USE
PROS -
1. RTX 206..."
337,5,Got this for 97k. Really a great value for money machine. RTX with top end processor under 1 lakh is very rare. You know it's good when it can run Cyberpunk2077 at full HD with DLSS and RTX enabled. Turbo cooling is a plus. Good design with RGB keyboard. Loving it.
338,5,"This is the best that you will get it this price range. Superb display quality and top notch performance.

Battery life could have been better."
339,5,"So after waiting almost a year and looking at every gaming laptop that comes and goes....finally this beast came during sale and I got it for only 96k the best deal ever. Considering the performance this was a steal.

Pros -
1. Screen - very very good.... Awesome colours and damn the screen is so bright most of the time I have to keep it at 50-60%.
Plus the 144hz screen is smoooooooooth.
(Small Con - screen bleeding is there but it depends on each different unit also its not a problem while g..."
340,5,"After waiting for eternity to purchase a good Laptop at a good price, I had given up on i7+RTX specs under 1Lac but suddenly came across this product under 1 lac, did a bit of research and finally bought it. Have been using it for about a month and so far feels like a remarkable purchase! Laptop is very smooth, feels very premium, can handle many resource hungry games like a piece of cake, impressive looks, great RGB keyboard with amazing heptic feedback, touchpad is very smooth, heat dissipa..."
341,5,"needed a laptop that would cover my gaming needs for the next 2-3 yrs and 144Hz was must.
So, within 1 lakh budget I think this is the best gaming laptop to get.
battery life is average
I was bit worried about heating issue but GP65 surprised me, heating management is way better compared to other gaming laptop"
342,5,Very good product.
343,5,A beast with value for money
344,5,The new silver colour near keyboard area is very good.....Looking premium...I wish back also was same colour...Rest all same as GL6G
345,5,"Got it at a price of 97k, current price is 146k. I was shocked to see it rise that much. amazing laptop for high end gaming, with great aesthetics."

353,5,Nice thank
354,5,super but backlit is not working
355,1,Over Heating
356,4,"pros:
1. cooler boost keeps laptop reasonably cool.
2. display is nice
3. boot time and loading time is also great thanks to ssd

cons:
1. 8gb ram is not enough
2. out of 512gb you get around 380gb ssd although fast is not enough.
3. performance according to price is great but gtx 1650 in other laptops is better than 1650ti maxq
4. speaker is clear but has no base and is poorly positioned

If you want to buy this laptop be ready to shed more money on storage and ram"
357,4,"Honestly this is my first laptop
I think its good but not sure though
But with decent specs its the best in this price range with max q and ti
And it also comes with the 2 year warrenty
I think its decent for its price range and the best one to get i cant give you the full review yet but as far as i have used its fun
Thanks for the product"
358,3,"Good graphics performance but still You'll not feel it's 9th Gen I5 processer.
You'll feel lags in each task like opening windows explorer or editing videos.
Video rendering speed is very good but while editing it hangs so many times.
I have another Asus i5 processer without graphics but that's working like MAKHAN
Keyboard is also little different so it takes time to get used to it.
And yes you'll see it's heating more than normal when you're rendering videos or playing games"
359,5,"I am writing this review after 2 weeks.
Just go for blindly if you got it for around 60k ,

The i5 with GTX graphics card games gonna run smoothly
You can All games can play in 60fps according to your customisation
And modern games like valhalla ,days gone , resident above 50fps .
Webcam quality is ok.
Display quality is superb. And have less bezels.
If you experience any lag connect the charger and keep the battery in Windows at best performance mode and select extreme performance mode in..."
360,4,"Everything is perfect üòä
Just only issue is that it has only single fan yes it has heat pipe connected to both cpu and gpu but still single fan is not enough to cool this powerful beast
Maybe a cooling pad will help"
361,5,"Don't think twice just go for it...
Battery is OK don't expect good battery backup in gaming laptops.
Ssd Is fast and if you want to change from those core companies like dell and asus go for msi you will not regret it..
If you want second options go for asus tuf or Lenovo legion y540 but if you are getting this laptop under 57000 then go for it"
362,4,Everything is fine performance is good build quality is nice but major minus is track pad its not at all working even though i try shorcut keys its not working you have to order extrnal mouse.. Touchpad is not working (Even i press FN+F3)
363,4,"performance is super, üîã back up and display also good, design is ok, got the product in big billion day at reasonable price, first time tried MSI by ignoring HP as I listened recently from many, they said performance wise MSI is the best. Now experiencing it, everything is good till today. writing this review after 1 month, has to see how long it will work better. thank you"
364,4,"Very good gaming laptop in this price range. There is one issue I faced when I play heavy games, The laptop heats a lot. Otherwise doing daily works its not get heated.
I have searched the gaming laptops quiet sometime. But this laptop is more updated on the previous one. I would suggest who is looking for i5 processor in a gaming laptop just go for it. You really liked this beast..."
365,5,"Initially i work on this laptop 12 hours and after i play game like fifa nfs its cool still now around last 2 week's i used pretty much happy with the laptop,there ate few things i miss like msi should provide atlist one more usb port.. because if you used a lot of gadgets then surely you will feel shortage of usb others still now can't complains about the laptop"
366,5,It's very good to this price.....I really thankful to flipkart üòäüòò.... it's very good experience with flipkart.... thank you...üíô
367,5,"Seriously awwsm .. pls go for it without any hesitation.. the performance look wise so good budget friendly... Can be used for online class, online xms, browsing,and also for mid range games, basic level programming tally and all.. preferable to clg students"
368,4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
369,5,"Performance are too good and friendly budget and also I love to buy this product very happy to this thanks Flipkart for the lovely product ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è.
I'll give 5 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüíØ"
370,4,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it
and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .

When you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and featur..."
371,5,"a god product for students, i'm writing this review after use of 1 month, if you use it only for online class and watching you tube then it's best for you & also its consumes less data if you setting in metered connection. so don't worry about data consumption.

pros- good battery back up & charging very fast, clear resolution screen and it's comes with a classy look

cons- a little bit slower, * It's takes 30-40 sec to open and after open it takes 3-5 sec to being ready to use and the ref..."
372,3,"Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though.. Don't go for this if you are into high end games. Othe..."
373,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
374,1,"Its my review after used after 5 months.
Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes.
Issues:
1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port.
2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs.
3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp.
4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work.
5. In sunlight one ..."
375,3,"Just an okay product.. Its a month now and these are my feedback.
Performance is okay for people use to surf and watch films.
Quality is average.. tapping on mouse pad is like tapping on cardboards. I expected a bit more quality.
Few irritants are no capslock light.. u have no idea if the caps is on or not, especially when u type passwords.. other one is the on/off button.. this is just like another key on keyboard without light again.. if the screen lits up only then u could realise the syst..."
376,5,"The best you can get, looks and performance both are to notch, supreme battery life, ultra fast speed. Display and sounds are fantastic, never seen any better till now. Till now it was, Apple was offering 7 at the price of 10, looks were alaways 10 out of 10 but now Apple is giving 15 at the price of 10.. Absolutely worth the price."
377,5,"At the current scenario where a proper Graphics card windows laptop is costing around 1.2 lakh at a min.
This MacBook Air M1 is the best deal and I got it around 82k so I received the best deal.
So we can now say Apple Laptop is cheaper in price than Windows."
378,5,"My first Macbook and no regret that I waited for this.
Sleek design, lightning speed, super light weight and silent as a wolf.
If you want to have a laptop that is super cool in look as well as performance, go for it."
379,5,"Ultimate machine, best laptop I have ever used hands down. M1 macbook air is more powerful than any previous generation Mac or any Windows laptop. Awesome purchase. Thank you Flipkart"
380,5,"So it‚Äôs the best computer in the world rite now Period.
You don‚Äôt need to worry about anything and I‚Äôm not gonna say about performance cause there are a lot of videos on YouTube already and of course there are other upgrades you can do to your laptop may be you need pro but this is nothing less..
thanks to Flipkart for amazing and timely and secure delivery
Great service keep the good work and keep getting betterüëçüèº"
381,5,"Amazing product, I think most of people won't need more than this. It provides best value for money. I am using this for mobile app development and it works like charm."
382,5,"The M1 macbook air is the best value for money. Amazing speed, gorgeous display, superb endurance and best in class aesthetics. If u are a non gamer and buying a laptop for serious work, this beast is the one to get( not even macbook pro, since benchmark scores are negligible). A small heads up: The upcoming M2 mac airs are even more powerful but are also costlier and come in garish colours which i personally dislike. So don't wait for the next gen. Just get the M1 air now. U won't be disappo..."
383,5,"Bought this laptop a week ago and I can say proudly that this is the best machine to date that I have used for my day-to-day tasks. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
* Blazing fast performance in every task that you throw at it.
* Insane battery life (14- 15 Hours) on a single charge.
* The Retina display with true tone technology gives you very natural colors which have support for the P3 color gamut.
* Instant wake up after sleep.
* The OS Ma Big Sur makes every task very smoothly.
* No t..."

1. Using it mainly for coding purposes, browsing and all that regular stuff. Haven‚Äôt played any games on it so I can‚Äôt comment on battery life and performance while gaming but with regular coding stuff like web development, mobile app development, web browsing etc the battery will easily last for 10+ hrs or even more.

385,5,This is my first MacBook. Already using an iPad and i-phone. Using the best of windows laptop given by office but this MacBook is a beast and completely. overshadows the windows. Takes a while to gets hands on but I am loving it day by day thanks flipkart or this amazing deal
386,4,"Bought this laptop two weeks back for my home use. Good one.
Pros :
good processor
good sound/speaker
build quality is ok.
connectivity is good.
display is good
speed is good due to SSD
no heating issue, as of now.
Sleek, thin and light weight which is the main highlight of this laptop.
8 GB RAM (expandable)

cons :
display could have been better especially from angles a little bit problem
No ehternet port (RJ45). But this is not a big issue while using at home, it is not required. ..."
387,3,"Display is not good problem in veiwing angle
Performance is very good much faster than i3
Build is okay okay
I'm having problems while plugin usb its not easy to plug in or plug out usb although usb is functioning fine"
388,4,"Great budget laptop in this price range. Performance is good and premium look. It's 15.6 inch laptop but then it looks like 14 inch laptop, very sleek and handy design. Awesome natural silver colour. I love the product from hp. Only back light keyboard is missing... overall glad to have this laptop."
389,4,"I have been using this product for some 2 days now and here is my initial feeling about it. Looks good but feels kind of low budget to the touch, but it is to be expected in the price range. The ssd is well performing and the three ports function as advertised. The screen is good too but wit limited viewing angles.
One thing that i noticed was that the top part of the laptop is heavier than normal and i dont know why. Over all the laptop is light weight and performance has been good.
I would..."

393,5,A really good laptop at a great price !
394,4,Good
395,5,"Laptop is very good, slim, light weight, very quick response because of SSD, battery backup is 5hrs.
Overall happy with this product, only one cons. Is internal storage is only 256 GB SSD."
396,5,"Good product. Quite silent, low heating and the performance is just amazing. Desogn wise i didn't like the keyboard that much as the keys are designed and protruded in old styled keybords, i find the lenovo keypads better than these but overall the design is good.
It's a 15.6 inch laptop but it's so sleek and super light weight compared to its counterparts.

406,5,"Trust me go for it ... No other laptop in this price range can give you this specs and level of performance.

I played valorant with low settings at max resolution and it's performance was astonishing .... I've seen 330fps max ...and avg 275fps at this setting.

Temperature was normally increased ...not too much

But when I played intensive games like watch dogs 2 it heated rapidly though in controlled way. I undevolted Cpu temp and temperature reduced by 15-20¬∞ which I was getting while play..."
407,5,"This the best laptop ever in this price ..specially for designer's ..I will recommend to buy this laptop it is a beast üî•‚ù§Ô∏è..
Battery life should have been improved more but that's ok ..we can't get everything soo perfect üòâ"
408,5,"Seems good so far.....Been using it for a week and everything looks good. The only downside is that the display could have been a bit better (no 72% NTSC coverage :(
I would say that if you got a few more bucks to spare then go with the Helios or Triton which have a better display with 72% NTSC color gamut coverage"
409,5,"In a market flooded with GTX1650s and GTX1650Tis, this is the one-budget gaming laptop that separates it from all.

A 1660Ti is almost 47% better performing than 1650 and with additional memory, you can future proof it too. The performance in this beat is splendid. I played Cyberpunk 2077, Far Cry New Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, all in high settings, 55-75 fps easily.
For competitive FPS games like Valorant, Rainbox Six Siege, all high to medium settings, 160-210 fps.

The 144Hz is so goo..."
410,5,"So 1660Ti, 144Hz display, 512 GB NVME SSD and 16 GB RAM at 75k? This should be a no brainer.
Only con I can think of is the 9th gen i5-9300H which is slightly aging in 2021 but can still hold its own.
Other than that for someone like me coming from a 2nd gen i3 and 750Ti this laptop is too good to be true."
411,5,"This is the cheapest gaming laptop in the market with 6gb vram. With 16gb ram, the laptop design is nice. The fan does get loud while Gaming in performance mode but as soon as you change it to normal mode, the fan will be super quiet. The keys are nicely spaced and feels good while typing. The touchpad is not that good but it would be scarcely used if you are Gaming on this. I'm able to get great performance on this. It's worth every penny. Just go for it."
412,4,"Very powerful laptop if you are looking for gaming
But here are some cons according to me -
1. Just 2 hours battery life isnt good
2. HDMI is 1.4 and not 2.0 so it won't support gaming above 120hz if you are thinking of plugging in an external monitor
3. The type C ports do not work as display ports and only function as a USB port

Other than these the laptop works fine and has good thermals after undervolting the CPU"
413,5,"Best in the market
Got it for 75k
For this price it is a well worth product
And gtx 1660ti is an actual beast"
414,5,"just got this early morning.. till now its working well.. will update in a few days.. (p.s. it does get a hot little.. probably will have to work on undervolting and repasting , but temp are good compare to other gaming laptops"
415,5,So After using this for 2 months. I think I am qualified to write this. Performance on this laptop is amazing the dual channel 16 gigs of RAM paired with 6gigs Of GPU memory runs everything like a charm . Battery is average not very bad but definitely below standard for office laptops but above average for Gaming Laptop. The biggest problem i have faced so far is of storage you get a little less than 500gigs and that's very less if you are fond of playing newer AAA titles.
416,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."
417,5,"Don't waste your money for assemble pcüòé.

It's good to know about laptop thing. Premium budget laptop better than assemble desktops.

Good buy if your budget is low and you wanted a fine good looking thing for basic uses like net surfing, watching movies with your partner üòç and of course study also.
Buy this."
418,5,"Windows 10 (single user) and McAfee (valid for 1 year) are installed when you switch on the laptop. It was a challenge to figure out installing the free MS Office Student 2019, as there is no key or note on how to install. Call to Flipkart turned out to be useless as the executive suggested returning the product, which did not make sense. Clicking on either word or excel or power-point in the programs installs the software. Pretty simple process.

420,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings.
Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
421,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
422,5,"After 6 months, I decided to write up a review. Originally I was skeptical about the laptop as many people said it arrived in a defective condition.

I expected this to last around 5-6 months but it has already outpaced that assuming the reviews, but here's a review I decided to make.

For budget, this is pretty good for some work and light gaming. I occasionally use it for medium-level video editing and it holds well. McAfee only lasts a month though, so kinda weird

For heavy gamers on a bu..."
423,5,"Got it for 24k during ""Big Savings Day"" and it is totally worth it. Ryzen series processors are the best, display is Full HD, Sound is decent and battery backup is fair enough.. Go for it.."
424,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k.
Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed.
If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought.
But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.

Pros:
1. Design is good, display is good.
2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen.
3. Comes with MS office
4. Speakers are good.

Cons:
1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
425,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use.
Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series).
Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed).
I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD.
Display is very good with decent viewing angles.
4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
426,5,"The best you can get, looks and performance both are to notch, supreme battery life, ultra fast speed. Display and sounds are fantastic, never seen any better till now. Till now it was, Apple was offering 7 at the price of 10, looks were alaways 10 out of 10 but now Apple is giving 15 at the price of 10.. Absolutely worth the price."
427,5,"At the current scenario where a proper Graphics card windows laptop is costing around 1.2 lakh at a min.
This MacBook Air M1 is the best deal and I got it around 82k so I received the best deal.
So we can now say Apple Laptop is cheaper in price than Windows."
428,5,"My first Macbook and no regret that I waited for this.
Sleek design, lightning speed, super light weight and silent as a wolf.
If you want to have a laptop that is super cool in look as well as performance, go for it."

You don‚Äôt need to worry about anything and I‚Äôm not gonna say about performance cause there are a lot of videos on YouTube already and of course there are other upgrades you can do to your laptop may be you need pro but this is nothing less..
thanks to Flipkart for amazing and timely and secure delivery
Great service keep the good work and keep getting betterüëçüèº"

432,5,"The M1 macbook air is the best value for money. Amazing speed, gorgeous display, superb endurance and best in class aesthetics. If u are a non gamer and buying a laptop for serious work, this beast is the one to get( not even macbook pro, since benchmark scores are negligible). A small heads up: The upcoming M2 mac airs are even more powerful but are also costlier and come in garish colours which i personally dislike. So don't wait for the next gen. Just get the M1 air now. U won't be disappo..."
433,5,"Bought this laptop a week ago and I can say proudly that this is the best machine to date that I have used for my day-to-day tasks. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
* Blazing fast performance in every task that you throw at it.
* Insane battery life (14- 15 Hours) on a single charge.
* The Retina display with true tone technology gives you very natural colors which have support for the P3 color gamut.
* Instant wake up after sleep.
* The OS Ma Big Sur makes every task very smoothly.

1. Using it mainly for coding purposes, browsing and all that regular stuff. Haven‚Äôt played any games on it so I can‚Äôt comment on battery life and performance while gaming but with regular coding stuff like web development, mobile app development, web browsing etc the battery will easily last for 10+ hrs or even more.

2. Apple nailed the thermals on this mac..."
435,5,This is my first MacBook. Already using an iPad and i-phone. Using the best of windows laptop given by office but this MacBook is a beast and completely. overshadows the windows. Takes a while to gets hands on but I am loving it day by day thanks flipkart or this amazing deal
436,4,Seriously need to improve battery drains fast on continues use otherwise performance is too good . Try to improve battery otherwise it's good . Battery wise and performance wise lenovo ThinkPad is best for this price. Only think I bought this instead of lenovo ThinkPad is HP is branded
437,5,"I did some fair research before going for this one.

First:
I was looking for a laptop with full version MS Office so that I can carry out WFH things with ease.
Second:
I wanted a high performance laptop with good RAM and space to run several applications at once.
Third:
I am a big time Gamer, so needed a Graphics Card.
Fourth:
Price should fit in my budget.

This laptop has all 4 of them. Couldn't be happier.

You can go for this with eyes closed if your requirements are same as mine."
438,5,"Pretty decent laptop for the price. Full metal body. Display is really bright. Good sound. Performance is decent with rendering. Keys are backlit, pretty evenly spaced. Doesnt heat up much."

Neatly packed nd delivered.


Thank you flipkart!"
440,4,Worthy
441,4,"This product is actually good. For performance, space, design, screen quality, responsiveness, weight I will give it 10/10. The only issue I face is that I expected more battery life.
With normal usage I think it last upto 3-4 hours. Rest I am happy with this product

442,4,Nice
443,5,"Everything good , but battery backup is very low max 2hr, but mentioned in specifications 12hr"
444,4,"Browser hanging while playing 2k-4k videos on youtube, overall good performance, battery backup is not as expected"
445,4,Battery backup is low about 4 hours otherwise it is fantastic.
446,2,"Webcam quality is extremely poor. Build quality is poor. Keyboard is mediocre. If you have large hands like me than avoid this laptop. Always check product like laptop in person that you will be using on daily basis for personal and professional purposes before making purchase.

This laptop is not recommended for coding purposes. Keyboard is extremely fragile.

Laptop body is magnet for greasy smudges. Better opt for metal body laptop."
447,4,The laptop is pretty descent for normal usage.Battery will disappoint you a liitle bit As i am a student so i usually have to attend 4 to 5 hours of online class but it goes around 4 and half hrs only...in normal usage. Not for any kind of gaming.. The display is mesmerizing.... it's really crispy clear and vibrant. Too lightweight. The blue color with shiny gradients looks awesome. Audio is quite consistent and clear ( no distortion even at high volume). But i must say this laptop is not for...
448,5,"Very Good Product. nice build quality, nice compact design. Very fast and responsive."
449,4,Flipkart packing was not good. Laptop box was kept in a large flipkart box without any bubble wrap or support and it was moving around inside - could have caused damage to laptop but luckily it was not damaged. The laptop is good. Software as promised. Office student version is free lifetime. Mcafee antivirus is free for 1yr. Finger print sensor works well. Overall good laptop.
450,5,It runs very smoothly with a fast operation speed. One of the best option for people who work on regular basis and needs fast operations done. Did not used for gaming and other high end softwares but I feel it will not disappoint you.
451,5,"It very good laptop for daily use , I am working from home and using this daily 9 to 10 hours and it's working fine, I have to charge one time only and battery backup is almost 9 to 10 hours according to my usage. Speed is also very good, one problem is you can not upgrade RAM in this laptop if required and always need to work under 8GB RAM. Overall it's good laptop. You will also get windows 10 and office 2019 license. I am using since last 1 month and working fine without any issue."
452,4,"Pros
-looks good, I got the dream white one and it looks premium from the top,display is also good
-Till now performance is nice, the 11th gen i5 CPU delivers is fast, boot time is a few seconds. Used it for coding with VS and till now it works well.
- Comes with windows 10, office , mcafe for an year
- Fingerprint lock is fast and efficient.
- Battery life is ok, can give 5-6 hours, with light use.

Cons
-the keyboard and mousepad, esp. the mouse pad looks cheap and fragile. Not recommended ..."
453,5,"Excellent Product by Asus.
Nice build quality."
454,5,One of the best laptop in Processing & Multitasking category.

Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.

463,5,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
464,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor.
also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :)
and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review...
thanks for making such good product, apple."
465,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
466,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.

I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product..
I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better.
With each update the functionality becomes better.
i will divide this mac in between pros and cons.
PROS:
1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously.
2) Can edit videos..."
469,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
470,5,"It's a perfect entry laptop....At start, laptop looks a bit slow, but with all the updates, it goes decent enough for an i3 processor..Battery life is very good considering it's 11th gen..Build quality is good but it's plastic, you won't get a metallic frame at this price point..8 gb ram is sufficient enough...If you want it to boot faster, you should equip it with an SSD..Finally, Display is too good at it's price point..

After a month of usage, I find no issues...The laptop looks very good.."

476,3,Guys the laptop is only good for light purpose if you want to do gaming or any heavy work better not buy it. For heavy work it's just waste of money. I tried to run some mid end games. This lappy even can't support them. Better do research before buying.

It work only for 3 hour üò§üò§ up to 12 hour is impossible . Second thing is these laptop has not contain 3 type A port . At the end all over is good enough.

481,5,"I am very happy and totally satisfied with this laptop. Afterall it meets all of my expectations. I would definitely recommend this laptop under 80K range.
Don't blindly compare specs only, what matters most is real ground performance. Hope you will make a good decision."
482,5,"The Asus ROG Strix G15 offers just enough performance to justify its 144Hz refresh rate.

In this price range display quality is best(144hz) and style and built is very good. Stylish looks due to the LEDs around it.

486,5,Beast!!! I have played Valorant And watch Dogs 2 at high settings. It maintains completely 144hz refresh rate. Battery Backup is sufficient. Can easily handle every game at at least 60fps. The Armoury Crate App is awesome. U can change modes and turbo boost your processor and GPU at higher frequencies. Overall Decent Product
487,5,"Initially bought it because there were no other laptops with 144hrz in this price range but with the introduction of nitro 5 with the same if not better specs and cheaper price. This shows less value for money. If you want rgb l, nitro 5 has it too. Only difference is the rgb on this is kinda unique with the bottom edges lit up. Else, other then that, performance wise as well, other machines can get better fps and the like."

5500m performs better than 1650Ti and is close to 1660ti max in low to medium settings..but suffers in high to ultra settings because of low VRAM, but still outperforms 1650ti in all settings. Thermals aren't as bad as compared to TUF A15...bottom panel design could have been better for improved airflow just keep your laptop elevated at 30¬∞ angle or on a cooling pad for better airflow...Haven't noticed any thermal throttling so far.

Display is fabulous.
Great build quality
Got it for 67k.
In that price gap its the best you can get.
Software and msi support is also great.
Only con you'll notice is that the trackpad is a little loose around the buttons, but its taken care by the multi-gesture support.
Super fast
Go for it."

512,2,"I purchased this laptop in Oct 2020. It is having 4gb RAM. Which is not enough to WIN 10 latest version. Getting very version slow. At least 8 gb RAM is required.
Now I need to upgrade with new extra RAM of same frequency to put in second slot. Alternatively I advice all to go for SSD hard disk. Due HDD hard disk it is getting slow. Better go for laptop with SSD hard disk and 8 gb RAM. This will give good speed."

It comes with a sim card slot to operate even if your WiFi is down. The backlight keyboard also provides good visibility to work in the dark. The image quality is supreme. The internal functioning is lightning speed. Quick shutdown and reboot. It also comes with MS Office so all in all a good buy.

First of all, thankyou Flipkart for this Amazing deal.‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥
Got the product a few days back. So far looks so good. Speed is incredibly insane. This kind of machine gets manufactured once in decades. Points to consider:
1. Body (premium)
2. Looks / display (beautiful / retina display)
3. Compact (light weight)
4. Battery backup (12-15 hours / screen on time is somewhere between 8-9 hours)
5. Performance (wroooom superfast‚ö°)
Will update the complete review after 1 month of usage."

676,3,Performance is great. Build quality is pooooor!!!
677,5,Excellent battery and very nice performance.
678,4,"Very decent configuration on paper. Fairly decent to work with too.
My points of contention -
a. Loaded with tons of 'bloatware' - from HP, Microsoft etc.
b. Flimsy construction - especially the keyboard
c. Flimsier trackpad - absence of the left & right-click buttons, makes the trackpad an all-in-one piece of plastic which rattles on extended use. I'd suggest the use of an external mouse, right from the start

So, for 44K it's a good buy. Especially for WFH challenges and for online classes."

685,5,"It's an amazing device. The updates from previous generation like keyboard, speakers and microphones have really improved the user experience. I have not faced thermal throttling much, but the device do get hot under load due to the aluminium chassis. So working on heavy task with laptop sitting on top of your lap may be difficult. As a programmer dedicated page down, page up, end and home keys are really important, and I miss them a lot. However, the typing experience is quite good, not as ..."
686,5,My first macbook. Got it at 1.54L in the big billion days sale. Delivery was on time by Flipkart and TrueComRetail. Amazing laptop and super smooth computing experience. Installed Xcode and Android Studio to start my indie project. Works flawlessly. Best for development workloads.
687,5,"My first Macbook.. totally amazing. If you are a first time user like me, you need to be patient and give it at least a day to understand how it works differently from windows. It charges quite quickly (within an hour - 100%) and only has type c ports so if you want to use your external hdd or pendrives then do buy a ‚Äòtype c usb connector‚Äô as well. Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!"
688,4,"Absolutely amazing. The design and the slim profile is simply irresistible. Nothing you would find in any other laptop. Great display, great speakers, great keyboard, great touchpad and great battery life.
My only complaint is the performance. I bought it over Macbook Pro 13"" thinking it would be powerful enough. But it failed to meet my expectations. Run some graphics intensive task and you would know it's limitation. 3D stills would take forever to render, fans are very loud and it heats u..."
689,5,"Base configuration works great for regular tasks including light photo and video editing. No struggle in day to day. The screen is really fantastic and the speakers are the best on a laptop one can find. 16 GB RAM starts to fill up quickly so if you are someone who needs to multitask a lot (editing video + bunch of tabs + Spotify) you might start running out of memory. Delivery was quick and great, no complaints!"
690,5,"Great Deal in 1.55 lacs. The performance is Excellent with brilliant display , speakers and the touch bar but sometimes it gets heated after using an hour and also gives some electric vibrations while charging. Regarding the warranty, you need to have register online and contact the customer care.

694,4,Nice product with all new feature at this price range. Works really well with fast startup and shutdown. With Ryzen 7 processor the laptop is way faster that intel 5i model.
695,4,"After 7 days of usage:
The laptop is quite lightweight and well designed. Performance with Ryzen 7 4000 series is incredibly fast. Battery backup is decent, 5-6 while browsing the internet. Display is fair but the viewing angles are not that good.

The display brightness could be slightly better. Fingerprint scanner is blazing fast.

Consider purchasing this laptop for college work, normal gaming, coding work. Don't buy for gaming or color accuracy related work."
696,5,"Ryzen 7 is much more faster and its response time of finger print is fast enough...
I got this laptop in near about 58k . Battery backup is good for office or business purposes.

Even you may find lags while opening application that was already installed or installed from external sources. This review was made from my own experience and still if you looks for some budget laptop for light uses and study this may be good choice for those.

As many people where saying it's display is not good but according to me it's normal and it's support 4k at 60fps on youtube.

Edit 1-its start lagging idk why i only watch videos(offline) & pdf in it."
785,3,"Hardware specs and laptop design is okay for an entry label laptop for basis computing. The 1 TB HDD is good for storage, Ryzen 3 3300 U processor has done decent job with what all has been thrown over to it, 4 GB RAM has been fairly sufficient for the basis stuffs,(no heavy load or gaming actions)
The suggestion I have if this could have included a 128 GB SSD for OS and the 1TB HDD could have left for user data, then that would have made this a decent device with hardware specs and performan..."

Display quality - ok (720p)
Touch pad quality is very low"
789,5,This is super fast laptop in the budget segment. Good for school and college work. Due to SSD the speed is very fast. Can easily play games. Screen is very good but not great. Handles most of the daily work with pleasurest ease. Not sure if this can be used for video editing...but I hv seen videos which says so!!
790,4,"Laptop is really great. Before buying I was in confusion between Ryzen and Intel. After 7 days of usage, I felt no difference. I continuously use my laptop for office and movies at least 10 hours a day and didn't e even notice any heating problem. If you are looking for a laptop below 45k with good performance, just go for it."

2.charging is not increase more than 3 hrs, It has only 3 hrs supported.
remaining everything is perfect and i love this item in this cost 49,000 rs compare to HP,DELL.

I have suggested to all this is very good laptop which is having high configurations in this less amount."
802,4,"Got this laptop today, Didn't find any performance issue as disk is empty. Windows setup went smooth.

Pros
1. Got it at 47k, it's a good buy based on the configuration.

Cons
1. Material looks too off standard and feels like complete low quality plastic body.
2. Camera quality is too bad, Easily takes you back 15+ years. Better to assume this laptop doesn't have camera."

809,5,"The laptop is a beast...can run all the AAA titles around high to very high, RTX 2060 is upto the mark.

In terms of video editing i7 10th gen along with graphic does a good job, rendered 8 min video in premiere pro in just around 1:30 min, and a composition about 40 sec in after effects took 18 min, which is a remarkable time limit I must say.

Delivery might be late a day or two because of the time of pandemic but product will reach you

REVIEWS AFTER 8 DAYS OF EXTREME USE
PROS -
1. RTX 206..."
810,5,Got this for 97k. Really a great value for money machine. RTX with top end processor under 1 lakh is very rare. You know it's good when it can run Cyberpunk2077 at full HD with DLSS and RTX enabled. Turbo cooling is a plus. Good design with RGB keyboard. Loving it.
811,5,"This is the best that you will get it this price range. Superb display quality and top notch performance.

Battery life could have been better."
812,5,"So after waiting almost a year and looking at every gaming laptop that comes and goes....finally this beast came during sale and I got it for only 96k the best deal ever. Considering the performance this was a steal.

Pros -
1. Screen - very very good.... Awesome colours and damn the screen is so bright most of the time I have to keep it at 50-60%.
Plus the 144hz screen is smoooooooooth.
(Small Con - screen bleeding is there but it depends on each different unit also its not a problem while g..."
813,5,"After waiting for eternity to purchase a good Laptop at a good price, I had given up on i7+RTX specs under 1Lac but suddenly came across this product under 1 lac, did a bit of research and finally bought it. Have been using it for about a month and so far feels like a remarkable purchase! Laptop is very smooth, feels very premium, can handle many resource hungry games like a piece of cake, impressive looks, great RGB keyboard with amazing heptic feedback, touchpad is very smooth, heat dissipa..."
814,5,"needed a laptop that would cover my gaming needs for the next 2-3 yrs and 144Hz was must.
So, within 1 lakh budget I think this is the best gaming laptop to get.
battery life is average
I was bit worried about heating issue but GP65 surprised me, heating management is way better compared to other gaming laptop"
815,5,Very good product.
816,5,A beast with value for money
817,5,The new silver colour near keyboard area is very good.....Looking premium...I wish back also was same colour...Rest all same as GL6G
818,5,"Got it at a price of 97k, current price is 146k. I was shocked to see it rise that much. amazing laptop for high end gaming, with great aesthetics."
819,5,"Pros
Very good build quality
Looks very premium
Good perfomance
Decent battery life
Very good display than vivobook 14

You miss
Fingerprint scanner
Ms office free edition

Overall better than vivobook 14"
820,5,"So this is a very early review. I've bought this for mostly documentation, content consumption and light video editing. Basic stuff. Portability was one of my main focus before buying this, and the product delivers as promised.
It's light and sturdy, easily portable, I don't usually work during my train travels, but this laptop made me do that, as it's very easy to handle. Display is really good, sound is average, battery performance so for I get around 5 hours in full charge, I expected more..."
821,5,"Osm experience of msi I am very happy to see this, it is such a cool display and its color contrast is very bright. I am very happy to see that its battery backup gives 7 to 8 hours. It's body is full of alluminium glossy finish or metallic on keyboard side. Or its sensor touch is large in size so easily comfortable to run this laptop and it's fast charger 65 watt charges the laptop on about 1 hrs plz guys without hesitation go for it. It is a beast laptop worth it ü•∞üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
822,5,"Very few things to point as flaws in this one. Good specs and good value. The display while better among the lot and an IPS panel, could have had a bit better viewing angles. A lot of small things are positive - backlit keyboard, large battery, solid build quality, small form factor and light weight. Service I am told is iffy, and is a carry in compared to other players. No complaints as such, just go for it.

Do note that the charging light will light up only when the battery is actually cha..."
823,4,"Literally a best laptops u could go for:
A best top notch crisp display
A full metal, yes, a full metal how did I come up with this coz whenever I put this thing on charge I can feel a slight current all over it's body that's makes me sure about this thing has a metal body all over but not just top.
A best battery life that charge with in 1.5 hr.
About specs, the specs sheet express it all that how powerful this thing,
Best part of this thing is it comes with msi center program
Which really..."
824,4,"Build Quality is good.
Display quality is better than other laptops in the same range but not that great too.
I'm getting 5-6hrs of battery backup on moderate usage, like programming, browsing, YouTube all that stuff(no gaming).
Performance is amazing, no lags.
WiFi connectivity is good too.
Has 3 brightness levels of keyboard backlit.
Touchpad is responsive.
Laptop boots up within 8seconds.

It doesn't have Ethernet and USB 3 ports so you need to buy an adapter dongle for those."
825,5,"The only thing I would like to mention is that Battery could have been better. It is not as expected. Otherwise, it is a great deal with good display, processor, build quality etc."
826,5,"Simply Brilliant. The product feels so premium. The build quality is far superior. The camera and sound quality is above average but the performance of laptop is satisfying. Go for it if you're looking a laptop for productivity. The product is light weight and easy to carry anywhere. The keypad is crafted for a butter flow. SSD AND RAM IS EXAPANDABLE!

Looking forward to work with this beauty more. Maybe I will update my review again after 6 months. Until that time."
827,4,"Received the laptop just today, it's a beautiful piece with some flaws.

Cons first.
1. Durability: It comes with a pair of small hinges and the body is made of either polycarbonate or magnesium alloy, and although my Latitude 7280 is also made of magnesium alloy, this laptop doesn't feel as durable. You'll notice huge flex when pressing the lid and small bezels also don't help.
2. Display: The display has a warmer tone to it, I'll see and update if I am able to correct it in settings.
3. I/O..."
828,4,This the best laptop under 50000 range.. No comparison at all. Overall better then vivo book. The only con that I can spot is battery life isn't that great.. However its not bad. Could have been better
829,4,"Its a good laptop with Rzyen 3, its food for students for their basic works like working with Ms Office. Do not play game bcoz it got no graphics, graphics is inbuilt which is from AMD. Overall a good build quality from lenovo."
830,4,Best laptop in this range even you can do gaming in this best processor but problem in camera and speaker both are not good its like ceap quality overall this is good student laptop....
831,5,"Best budget laptop with this price. I bought one for my dad and another one for my sister -- all on the time of one week. We can upgrade RAM to 8GB from a local shop.

Performance: its good enough for students and teachers and business users.

Con: only one - it doesn't have an RJ45 port (can't connect LAN cable)"
832,4,"It's good starting laptop.
If you wanna do some multi tasking like opening Microsoft Teams a few tabs on Browser and a couple of Word files, the system will start to gasp hard. The processor is great but the bottleneck is the RAM.
So I got a 4GB Ram off market and now it can handle all the above mentioned tasks.
Hope this helps."
833,5,"I really needed a new and cheap laptop to attend online classes and to do assignments, with light gaming on the other side
I really liked that the Ryzen APUs have such amazing performance, as other reviewers said, the only bottle neck is RAM which windows and chrome usually hog and make the laptops performance slow. With a Ram upgrade of 4 GB (now total 8GB) 6 GB is actually usable but it makes a huge impact on performance as the extra ram is helping in every way to make the laptop very fluid..."
834,5,"Good design
I have upgraded with 8GB ddr4 2666 ram and added 250 SSD drive
Loaded windows in SSD drive, now the system is very fast and I am using for multitasking
You can purchase without any hasitation"
835,5,"In a price range like thus, I would say you are getting more than any other company would give. Quality is amazing and the best thing preloaded windowsüòçüòçüòç

I would give 5 star rating just because I never used AMD ryzen and this was my first experience which was better than any other processors."
836,5,"I loved this laptop. I wish they should have added needed accessories like keyboard mat , a laptop bag(compass like bag),cleaning liquid. Otherwise it's awesome in this price."
837,4,In such a price laptop is really great. They can work on ram capacity. Look wise this laptop slays its competitor at this price. Go for it. Really good for students of IT and such fields
838,4,It is a good budget laptop for students
839,5,"Good product. Quite silent, low heating and the performance is just amazing. Desogn wise i didn't like the keyboard that much as the keys are designed and protruded in old styled keybords, i find the lenovo keypads better than these but overall the design is good.
It's a 15.6 inch laptop but it's so sleek and super light weight compared to its counterparts.
The bezels of screen and keypad section are so trimmed out that when closed, due to Its small and sleek size it gives impression of a 1..."

849,4,Hi guys if you are a basic gamer then it's a good buy Intel i5 10th gen performance is good with GTX 1650 Ti GDDR6 is flawless. Display is excellent and very good for photography and real colors are exposed. Overall a very good buy. Value for money as of 7 days useage.
850,5,"Great laptop!
Incase you're facing screen fps reduction (60fps coming down to 40fps) or screen flickering when running on battery, then simply search and upgrade the intel uhd graphics drivers and turn off battery saver mode. Then go to intel driver software (search on windows after installation) and go to system menu-power tab and turn off the fps limiter. Restart the system and you're good to go!

RGB lights , Awesome.
Very good experience in FPS gaming.
Definately go for it , Its Fully Worth 62k , believe me."
859,5,"It's a very good laptop for daily usage. I bought this laptop for my work and I work on photoshop, premiere pro and many heavy softwares are working very smoothly.
Built quality is super its having aluminium chassis
Very light in weight and very fast in processing.
If you want a light weight laptop with performance then go for it ."
860,4,"It's very good product in this price bracket. I felt it little heavy, but compare to other products in this price .The weight will be manageable .This is good product.
I've another laptop Dell latitude 3400 14intch. Compare to that this is very good .Boot up and shutting down very fast."

Build quality and 2 in 1 facility in extraordinary
A bit low sound but clarity is amazing
Best for students."
862,5,Cute little superior beautiful piece and performance just wow best deal .!
863,5,Best in it's segment only shortcoming is they should provide it's Pen also......For regular use it is more than sufficient.. Otherwise it's a delicate darling need to be taken care of properly
864,5,"Good laptop at this price range. Performance based also good but not for heavy work. For simple use like, MS office work, watching videos and surfing i3 is much enough. Handling multitask smoothly. Bit hevy than expected. Stylus pen not come with this product its vry disappointment. Battery - 4 to 5 hours (continues work) charging time - 0 to 100% took around 1 hour 20 minutes. Over all gud. Worth buying."

3. Only 2 USB ports
4. No Bag / No Pouch Provided for Carrying"
866,5,Device is wonderful. I have been using windows 8/10 since its inception and how windows has improved over these years have been very unbelievable as windows updates are basically a disaster but windows experience in this laptop is very different as i am also using a mac parallel to windows for my personal multimedia needs but i have been using an HP 15 series for 5 years for my business accounting needs with built in windows 10 trust me after 5 years i switched to pavillion for the same and t...

Didn't find the product name in asus promo while registering for offer.It get little bit heat up while coding but become Normal after some time but overall good laptop.

871,5,"It's A Greatest Product if You are on A budget! I got it for 57k !
Its good cause it has two GPU!
I ran games like Gta 5 high and medium setting at 1080 p, Rocket League high settings 1440p,
And very smooth experience just that laptop was too heated!
Otherwise go for it!

I had bought it for coding and it works as champ!"
872,4,Very nice laptop and look also good
873,5,"Not 'THE BEST' for gaming. But if you are into development, this thing is best.

Some highlights of this laptop:
- Very portable

- WiFi 6
- SSD gives copying speeds of 500-800 MBPS
- Responsive fingerprint scanner."
874,5,This is my first laptop with this brand and I'm happy

How many Upgradeable RAM this laptop."
879,3,"This is my initial review after 2 days of use.

Very much unhappy with flipkart and lenovo combination, I received laptop on 1st may and lenovo website gives only 10 months warranty i.e. valid till March 2022.

I guess it's not taking my purchase date from flipkart instead when flipkart purchased from lenovo is considered, it's really not acceptable.

Positives :

- We have light for ..."
880,5,"Good product for office and student work battery life is average üëçüëç overall good product ,""not for gaming""...."
881,5,Good product at these price range!!!
882,4,I'm happy...in this range... it's superb...
883,3,Nice
884,3,It's takes time to start the laptop. Other wise it's good with this budget and brand value
885,2,Webcam quality is not good very poor camera
886,1,It tests your patience !!!!!
887,3,For normal purpose it's ok
888,1,Worst laptop. Very slow. Money waste. Plz don't buy this laptop. I used for 1 month
889,5,"Well a good product at the price range below 50K
It does have a ssd slot and yes due to single channel 8gb ram and hdd it will lag a bit...but once you uninstall msi app player it will work smoothly... To get the optimal performance of the processor and gpu you should add another 4gb or 8gb ram stick...and I can assure it will work smooth as hell....ovell a good laptop...
Due to 8gb ram it will lag in games a bit ...but that's not the problem of device.....you can add another stick of ram"
890,5,"This price is okay. Performance is very good. Without SSD laptop ON within 45sec. Condition is very good.
Hardware is very good. Personally recommended for data science."
891,4,laptop is owsom in this price range i got this under 50k value for money product but i feel lag while using it its due to hdd but not a problem i will upgrate it . otherwise this laptop is king of under 50k
892,5,Well nice for gamingüëçüëç
893,5,bought for 49990. works pretty smoothly. i5-9300h is still beast processor even in 2021.doesnt weight a lot so you could carry it around. only weakness is battery but gaming laptop usually doesnt have much battery backup anyway.
894,5,"The laptop is amazing,it will give you 120+fps in almost every game but you should play game while charger is plugged and if you want to speed up then I should recommend you to uninstall msi app player and upgrade SSD in future.over all the laptop is a beast."
895,5,Amazing laptop good for gaming and regular use. Best in this price range
896,2,"Laptop was good but over heating, temperature is raising up to 80 degrees entire keyboard is heating too much"
897,4,"2 draw back one is SSD atleast 128gb SSD could be provided and only GTX 1650 max q, TI was needed. On back side no logo of windows so no proof of original OS."
898,3,The factory seal is sticked above the screw on the back panel. That is really nasty for user upgradation.You can't remove the back panel without breaking the seal.
899,5,Superb üòÄüëåüèª
900,5,The sound quality and performance is superb. The battery backup when compared to MacBook air is satisfactory.
901,1,The device heats up just after 3-4 minutes of normal usage like simple browsing.
902,4,"Unable to register the apple.warranty. The purchase date validation isn't working.

Can some one guide.."
903,3,Issue with the keyboard and device hangs occasionally when i have not even installed any new softwares of my own.
904,3,"The Display provided is a TN Panel it looks dull with washed out colors or else it's a pretty good laptop. If you you are not into watching video, playing games, editing stuff you can go for it. The battery is good, performance is good, build quality is good but not to the mark of think pad L and T Series."
905,5,Awesome system. Perfect for office work. Runs adobe Premiere pro smoothly. Very good build and long battery life. One ram and one hdd slot vacant so you can upgrade the storage and ram in future.
906,2,Heating issue
907,5,"So far so good.
Display is poor, but for development works it's adequate, you can connect external display.
Performance is better than i5. But still it's early days, so it may Change after 2 months.
Battery is not great but it is okay.

For software development and office works it is a great laptop."
908,5,Superb laptop.
909,5,"Trust me go for it ... No other laptop in this price range can give you this specs and level of performance.

I played valorant with low settings at max resolution and it's performance was astonishing .... I've seen 330fps max ...and avg 275fps at this setting.

Temperature was normally increased ...not too much

But when I played intensive games like watch dogs 2 it heated rapidly though in controlled way. I undevolted Cpu temp and temperature reduced by 15-20¬∞ which I was getting while play..."
910,5,"This the best laptop ever in this price ..specially for designer's ..I will recommend to buy this laptop it is a beast üî•‚ù§Ô∏è..
Battery life should have been improved more but that's ok ..we can't get everything soo perfect üòâ"
911,5,"Seems good so far.....Been using it for a week and everything looks good. The only downside is that the display could have been a bit better (no 72% NTSC coverage :(
I would say that if you got a few more bucks to spare then go with the Helios or Triton which have a better display with 72% NTSC color gamut coverage"
912,5,"In a market flooded with GTX1650s and GTX1650Tis, this is the one-budget gaming laptop that separates it from all.

A 1660Ti is almost 47% better performing than 1650 and with additional memory, you can future proof it too. The performance in this beat is splendid. I played Cyberpunk 2077, Far Cry New Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, all in high settings, 55-75 fps easily.
For competitive FPS games like Valorant, Rainbox Six Siege, all high to medium settings, 160-210 fps.

The 144Hz is so goo..."
913,5,"So 1660Ti, 144Hz display, 512 GB NVME SSD and 16 GB RAM at 75k? This should be a no brainer.
Only con I can think of is the 9th gen i5-9300H which is slightly aging in 2021 but can still hold its own.
Other than that for someone like me coming from a 2nd gen i3 and 750Ti this laptop is too good to be true."
914,5,"This is the cheapest gaming laptop in the market with 6gb vram. With 16gb ram, the laptop design is nice. The fan does get loud while Gaming in performance mode but as soon as you change it to normal mode, the fan will be super quiet. The keys are nicely spaced and feels good while typing. The touchpad is not that good but it would be scarcely used if you are Gaming on this. I'm able to get great performance on this. It's worth every penny. Just go for it."
915,4,"Very powerful laptop if you are looking for gaming
But here are some cons according to me -
1. Just 2 hours battery life isnt good
2. HDMI is 1.4 and not 2.0 so it won't support gaming above 120hz if you are thinking of plugging in an external monitor
3. The type C ports do not work as display ports and only function as a USB port

Other than these the laptop works fine and has good thermals after undervolting the CPU"
916,5,"Best in the market
Got it for 75k
For this price it is a well worth product
And gtx 1660ti is an actual beast"
917,5,"just got this early morning.. till now its working well.. will update in a few days.. (p.s. it does get a hot little.. probably will have to work on undervolting and repasting , but temp are good compare to other gaming laptops"
918,5,So After using this for 2 months. I think I am qualified to write this. Performance on this laptop is amazing the dual channel 16 gigs of RAM paired with 6gigs Of GPU memory runs everything like a charm . Battery is average not very bad but definitely below standard for office laptops but above average for Gaming Laptop. The biggest problem i have faced so far is of storage you get a little less than 500gigs and that's very less if you are fond of playing newer AAA titles.
919,5,"Excellent.. Quality of plastic and body is very nice.
Does not get heated with heavy browsing and watching movies online.
It has finger-print + power integrated button.
It came in a sealed and safe packaging.

Some issues:
Lenovo support shows its warranty till March 2022. A good side to that is it is Premier support (best possible)
You can extend its warranty to a max of 4 years."

I am impressed with the speed of the laptop. It's very good for day to day work. After using this device, I have made a decision to always go with an SSD only. 512 gb SSD and 8 gb RAM makes a great combination. Laptop is very fast.

961,5,Need to improve sound quality.
962,5,"Perfect product.
I must say lenovo has improved a lot. The 360 design is superb. It can be charged by a normal type c charger that you already have for your android mobile. So during travel you need not to worry about carrying an extra laptop charger. This laptop is so light weight.
I feels premium in hand. Web cam quality is the area where there is scope for improvement. Touch is working absolutely fine. They provide stylus without and extra charges, which is a good deal at this price point...."

touch screen is very good but laptop hinge is not so good
keyboard sound is good but whenever you press any key multiple time it will not work
space is little low you have to dump useless file every time."

970,5,Laptop colour should be better i think silver colour will be good
971,3,"Ok ok. Go for higher configuration with same cost and features in other brands. This has very low storage(250SSD, you will get only upto 210SSD). won't be sufficient if you install softwares.

1. Copy to external hard disk and vice versa is much faster.
2. Touch and Pen are smooth.
3. Good that Keyboard won't if flip the screen."
972,4,"Happy with my purchase. My first macbook and now I know why it's such a premium device. Fantastic display, sleek looks and performance to match. But unhappy with flipkart's delay with my order. But, in the end, everything was good and I hope it stays that way. For anyone migrating from windows to Mac os , it is a steep learning curve, but it is worth the trouble....."
973,5,5 star for the product. Overall talking about the product this is my first macbook i have never used mac before this i am amazed at the first glance and the speakers are amazing so loud it's like a mini woofer. I have not used much. I will give review after one month of usage.
974,5,"This is the best laptop I have ever purchased. It needs no introduction. Apple is Appleüí™üèª.

Thank you Flipkart ... 100% genuine , brand new ,comes with 1 year warranty !

check ur serial number here at Coverage.apple.com and see if your product has been registered.. if not registered,don't panic ... Send a message to apple support along with ur invoice and serial number ...they will activate your Coverage/warranty immediately !!!

**Blindly go for it**"
977,5,"Based the performance and ease of use, I love this machine"
978,4,"4 stars as i had to follow up with the warranty registration process with apple and it took me a week of follow up to finally get it registered. The macbook should be registered when the seller delivers it the serial number had issues.
Overall good laptop, good performance, good display, some mac related graphics switching issue which i am not sure how to get it fixed."
979,5,Great deal
980,5,Good deal
981,5,"I'm 100% content and pleased with the seller for the prior delivery than expected and the brand new impeccable product. I had an initial apprehension that the product might be ersatz or would be dilatory in delivery. All my doubts, however, were vanished when I received the authentic product."
982,4,"Got my first Macbook. I am really excited to explore this beautiful machine.
Initial impressions-:
- Build quality top notch full aluminum body.
- excellent look.
- Battery backup is not as claimed by company. In real world usage it is giving 6/8 hr back up.Here I am little bit disappointed.

I will put my full usage experience after 1 month."
983,5,"Nice Keyboard. It is very compact. Nice for heavy-duty daily work.
The size has become smaller compared to previous models. Though I do not have much
complain about the current dimensions, the previous dimension of a 13-inch laptop was better.

Cooling Fan noise irritates sometimes. Without much load, the fans turn on and you cannot turn them off. If you really do not need the quad-core core version simply go with dual-core one. That should be enough for most of the daily work."
984,5,Have received 2 days ago..Beautiful design..Working smoothly..A little bit of effort and time needed if you are switching from Windows but the experience have been pretty smooth so far. Need to invest in a few accessories like an USB hub or original software.
985,5,"It's the best out there, if you're a student go for it without a doubt. It's awesome. Great Work Apple."
986,4,It a amazing product but with one flaw which make it amazing and not absolutely amazing that is it's thermals. But not really a bumer with flew tweaks you can adjust it. Windows on bootcamp also works better than other windows laptop. Don't buy this if you are going to work in hot temperatures it requires a cool temperature.
987,4,"Just 2 weeks using this. Design, display is great. Performance is good. Only cons i found is battery life. It discharges a bit quickly."

990,5,Wow. This is very nice product. My first macbook. Looks so nice. Very slim and light weight
991,5,"This one is just too good. I bought it for some hardcore coding and it is good enough. The screen size is just perfect. The built, design and the color are top notch."
992,4,It doesn't work well after using it for 1-2months.. it's performance isn't really good as per the requirement of work from home but if you're looking for general use not that heavy work then it's great product as per the value that is given to it..
993,5,"At this price range this is the worthy product. Actually I am teacher and I have bought this for conducting online classes and do regular office works like checking emails, typing documents, accessing ERP... For all these kinds of works its fit quietly... People looking for system to do this kind of work may go ahead with this Acer 14 One... I recommend it..."
994,4,"At this price the product is awesome. I am using a 220 gb SSD in the main hard disk slot, and the 1TB had disk in a caddy via the cd drive slot. also upgraded the ram to 12 GB, the laptop runs like ""makkhan"". It can handle multi tasking. I use a separate display to extend my workspace and the processor handles it quite smoothly after aforesaid upgrade.

The only thing that disappoints me is the battery backup. With continuous work with ms word, chrome and some other windows open, it lasts rou..."
995,1,"Please do t buy this product. In two days on my experience I am saying battery backup is less the 2 hours. Very worst product. I never purchase this type of product from flipkart.

Flipkart team dont market this type of product. You may loose the value. If we use continuesly 2 hours system was hanging making lakhs of temparay files. Every one hour you need to clear the temparay files. For this I keep the fan also to cool the processor. If we keep the laptop on hands at working time it produc..."
996,5,Fastest Processor in this category...within 20 seconds the system start and you can start working .. you get 1TB SPACE AND 4 GB RAM ..RAM can be upgraded upto 12 GB...if you install a addition of 4 GB ram more then it will be work more excellently in speed.. It works just like i5 processor fast enough to hold any time of tasking..It comes with windows 10 home basic edition with 64 bit processor. It has latest microsoft office 365 version already installed in it. Plus point of this laptop is ...
997,5,"As compared to price it is the best one. For Home, Browsing, Online Class it is good one. It's take some time to start but then also it is ok. I would suggest if the camera quality should be increased to some extent for model. Its not bad but it can be improved to some megapixel by manufacturer. Rest all is fine as we cannot suggest more looking at the price."
998,5,"If you need laptop for online classes don't look elsewhere. This is simply sufficient to do the task. Looks beautiful. Got for 18500 after bank discounts and sitewise offers.
Windows is genuine. Boot time , speed, camera and sound are just like ok. Not the best obviously for the price asked but does the task without any hassle.
Office is trial version and that's a only lowside. DVD isn't present. So be reasonable in your expectations from sub 20k laptop. It will surely surpass them."
999,5,this is my review after 5 days best part is the battery its very good.... almost 6-7 hours backup. rest performance wise seems good so far got it in offer price of Rs 19000

1002,5,"Good design.
Battery initially gives reasonable backup of 6-7 hours, but may reduce on prolonged use.
Display is not good but manageable as it seems a bit faded.
Hinge is not the strongest , as I have been used to strong build quality of dell laptops.
Boot up and memory use is fast due to SSD.
Processor is also good.
All in all a value for money product as I got it for 40k"

I have purchased this mainly for doing android development and dual booted it with linux mint, surprisingly I can run android studio, emulator, and chrome simultaneously without any lag. And one more interesting things is that it gives you more performance while it is plugged in on AC adapter.

The dedicated graphics memory(VRAM) is 512MB only, definately it is not for gaming purposes, but if you are thinking to do develop..."

1006,4,"Used it for a week. I bought it knowing that the display is not really great, so not dissapointed. It is a good device for the price if processing power is your top most priority.

Performance - 5/5 : Very powerful, processor infact the most powerful in this price bracket. Very smooth so far, no lags found. I did not play any games. Boots up in 5-6 secs. SSD is of average speed.

1007,5,"Having now used this laptop for a week, I've found it to be an all round brilliant laptop that runs smoothly with no hiccups. This is perfect for those on a tight budget like me, who want a laptop for work, browsing the internet and watching videos, including a lil bit of video editing band gaming. As it's slim & lightweight with an acute design it's great for those on the go. The 8 GB RAM is definitely sufficient for those who just want to do what I mentioned above.

Pros:

The performance and design are the absolute best in this price (even at 50k) and you'll be blown away by the Hex Core Ryzen 5 4500u which is the beast powering this laptop. The keys are chiclet style and are good quality, no issues there. The top has a nice white colour and has a slight matte style fin..."

1032,1,"VERY POOR
Do not buy this seller as laptop is hanging and not working properly not booting fastly as it was mentioned it will take 12seconds to boot but it take 4-5min . And not giving refund and replacement pls dont buy from this seller and service center saying to deposit 6k for repair, speed is very slow ...Not replaced within 7 days policy...Only chat, messages & email....I am keeping this product aspiring not to buy from this seller..."
1033,4,Laptop was nice after using for 6 days I'm giving this review. Battery was good 4-5 hours for normal use. But for gaming it gives very low battery backup. Performance is also good. I have not found any issues till today.

1062,4,Seriously need to improve battery drains fast on continues use otherwise performance is too good . Try to improve battery otherwise it's good . Battery wise and performance wise lenovo ThinkPad is best for this price. Only think I bought this instead of lenovo ThinkPad is HP is branded
1063,5,"I did some fair research before going for this one.

First:
I was looking for a laptop with full version MS Office so that I can carry out WFH things with ease.
Second:
I wanted a high performance laptop with good RAM and space to run several applications at once.
Third:
I am a big time Gamer, so needed a Graphics Card.
Fourth:
Price should fit in my budget.

This laptop has all 4 of them. Couldn't be happier.

You can go for this with eyes closed if your requirements are same as mine."
1064,5,"Pretty decent laptop for the price. Full metal body. Display is really bright. Good sound. Performance is decent with rendering. Keys are backlit, pretty evenly spaced. Doesnt heat up much."

1083,5,A very nice laptop. You need to remove pre-installed apps in order to free memory(RAM). Build quality is really nice. If possible upgrade it with another stick of RAM in order to configure dual channel(approx 10-15% faster). SSD is really faster than normal SSD as it comes with NVME PCIe 3.0.

If it is glowing orange, it means your NVIDIA gpu is running. It is enough if it runs while playing games. If it is running all the time, your battery backup will be reduced to 2 hours. To resolve this, go ..."

Played Nfs the run on high settings on the first day itself and it ran smooth af. Gpu inside this laptop is 1650 max q which is slightly outperformed by 1650 but max q consumes less power
and therefore produces less heat. Since this laptop has only 1 fan, it was a smart decision by msi for improving the thermals of this laptop. As far as the graphics are concerned i ..."

Pros:
****

1. Display:

The display on this laptop is one of the better ones out there. With a close to 100% sRGB calibration and an anti glare coating, the Full HD LED Backlit IPS panel doesn't disappoints you. It's also good for people who do colour grading and similar stuff as the a..."

1107,4,Today got the laptop. I'll update soon . Only con is storage got only 177GB free and for normal using the processor will be fine . Don't try to play game . And speakers is not that much good .

1116,4,"Pros-
We'll built, good display, feels premium
Cons-
Expensive, speaker not loud enough, storage cannot be expanded"
1117,4,"It's really a good system specially for the students.
It's stylus pen works very smooth.
Full HD display. But webcam isn't very good.
Also not placed in a perfect location.
It has actual 470 GB of SSD.
Very nice Hinge Quality. Touch works very smoothly. Pre installed MS office, Macfree. Keyboard is giving a nice experience of typing.
Battery Backup is about 4-5 hours while continuously using.
Overall it's great 2in one convertible laptop at this price. I prefer everyone to go with this."
1118,5,"Better performance, nice touch screen rate, Finger print work fast to logon, great deal so recommend to buy this laptop."
1119,5,"Excellent features, the 10th Gen Intel and 512 GB SSD, the near Bezel less design and the 360 degree folding into a neat tablet has got me captivated. The build quality is Solid and really makes you feel its built to last. The illuminated keyboard and key travel is perfect. All in all..an excellent buy."
1120,4,"4GB base ram is an absolute sin otherwise the product is pretty much flawless IMO.
You will find your system suffocated in terms of RAM if you open up 3 applications at once. I remedied that by installing an 8GB memory stick into the laptop. Now it works perfectly.

-1 Star outright for having only 4GB ram"
1121,5,"Awesome experience. Loved it. Starting from its style to features, I found it wonderful. My first asus laptop and I love it."
1122,4,"Satisfy my(student) use.
One star less fr 4gb ram, which is really disappointing(but it can be extended to 12gb)
Otherwise laptop is good at this price.
Light weight, flexible, I can carry it anywhere.
Low graphics game can easily run.
Average battery life.
Audio is good fr laptop."
1123,5,"Much satisfied by the way flipkart delivered this even at the remote place....
Secondly the product out of the box amazed with its build design and the features especially the Touch screen..display...battery and other stuff captivate everyone's eye...."
1124,4,Good product. But touch is not as good as apple ipad which comes under 38k iPad. Touch should be more smooth just like phone as we are using.

i have used 1 week and i am writing this review.
battery-8/10
performance-8/10
sound-6/10
build quality-10/10
display-10/10
webcam-4/10
all is genuine , if u want 2 in 1 laptop in budget,then go for it.
for student,who only uses for educational purposes and light entertainment,its a blessing in disguise.
i will recommend this for student not for gamers."

1130,5,"Working smooth , Everything in it is very good, only except the battery ( lasts 5 hours with continuous live class streams on ms teams at 90% brightness ) which should have been 1-2hours more but overall it is excellent in this price range . Build quality is the best I have seen, gives a premium feel."
1131,3,"I got it yesterday and believe me I am very disappointed by its build quality and battery or charger I am using it at normal performance mode only watching YouTube videos and some application install it's warm up and battery drain fast and when I put in charging charger of this is very warm means very very warm

1143,5,Value for money.. and powerful gaming experience.
1144,5,"Writing this review just after 2 weeks
Great value for money
Great ml programming processing speed
My previous pc took almost 2 days of processing time
Whereas this one did the same in less than 2 hrs
Great gaming experience
The only problem I faced is that I couldn't install msi afterBurner
It always gavee an error
Every other things were great"
1145,5,"The system is amazing , and it's performance is optimum. You need to take care of it like a gaming laptop. It's heat output is little over normal. But that's understandable.
There are many reviews regarding bad battery life.....that is normal for high end laptops..."
1146,5,"Initial impressions after a couple of hours of using it:
- Looks good, feels good.
- Screen could be better but I'm not complaining. I use an external monitor for 3D'ing.
- Packs a good punch with 10th gen i7 & RTX2060.
- Decent keyboard but the red backlight could be polarising. I don't mind it.
- This one's a finger print magnet, so keep a microfiber cloth handy.
Haven't still tested it for Gaming though. Just hope MSI delivers on the service incase there's any problem in the future."
1147,5,"The product itself is very beautiful. Heats a bit initally but its okay for such ka slim device an all aluminum body. Screen is crisp and accurate. The haptic feedback is outof the world. Keyboard is nice and clicky. Can perform almost every task like breeze but struggles at games obviously its a mac not a gaming laptop. Its a bit heavy than i expected it to be. Overall its the best machine out there only the 16"" competes this. Flipkart delivery was slow."
1148,5,First time using an Apple product and I'm truly amazed. It runs super smooth and can easily handle demanding stuff. Plus the space gray color looks really cool.

If it is glowing white, it means that the intel integrated GPU is in use, ch is plenty for most the day to day usage. U should get atleast 5hours of battery. With power saving mode u can even get 6-8 hours.

If it is glowing orange, it means your NVIDIA gpu is running. It is enough if it runs while playing games. If it is running all the time, your battery backup will be reduced to 2 hours. To resolve this, go ..."
1174,5,"I bought this laptop after almost a month of research since I was on a tight budget. First impressions first. Beautiful build. Played Nfs the run on high settings on the first day itself and it ran smooth af. Gpu inside this laptop is 1650 max q which is slightly outperformed by 1650 but max q consumes less power
and therefore produces less heat. Since this laptop has only 1 fan, it was a smart decision by msi for improving the thermals of this laptop. As far as the graphics are concerned i ..."
1175,5,"Nice product. Comes with GTX 1650 Max-Q, display is very impressive, sound is very smooth,they had provided a cardboard base which in enhance the sound experience.
Writing this review after 2 months, earlier battery lasted for 7-8hr (wifi connected ), now it's reduced to 5-6hr (wifi connected).
It comes with a dust protector on back which was very dirty so I removed it. It has 1 month subscription for CyberLink power director, photo director and many such softwares , Norton antivirus pre in..."
1176,5,"So I have been using the MSI GF63 9SCXR-418IN since past 6 months now and here are my thoughts on it. To keep the review simple and fair, I have divided this review into Pros and Cons.
So let's get started.

Pros:
****

1. Display:

The display on this laptop is one of the better ones out there. With a close to 100% sRGB calibration and an anti glare coating, the Full HD LED Backlit IPS panel doesn't disappoints you. It's also good for people who do colour grading and similar stuff as the a..."
1177,5,This is the best Macbook that Apple has ever made. It is also one of the best laptops in the world right now. Definitely go for it.
1178,5,Excellent product
1179,5,Product is very good but delivery is very very bad
1180,4,Product is very good. But delivery system is poor form flipkart
1181,5,Powerful machine. Good battery life .
1182,5,"Battery is very good, no other laptop can beat the battery performance."
1183,5,"Ive been using this laptop for a while, it has an excellent performance,expect the battery dosent stay much longer but with proper use it can last longer
if you are looking for a laptop with a decent specs then you are in the right place
the 2 day delivery from flipkart is also satifying"
1184,5,"best laptop, light weighted and fast"
1185,4,"No backlit keyboard, very slim and charge stands only for 3 - 4 hrs"
1186,1,Worst laptop ever experienced. Please don't waste your money on this laptop. Very slow and battery lasts only 1 hr
1187,1,This machine is very slow and battery does not lasts long hardly for 1/2 hrs it works on battery. HP need to improve a lot in this. Please do not buy this machine. I want replacement of my machine.
1188,1,battery backup only 1.5 hours.
1189,1,Battery Backup Is Worst It's 1.5 hour Only Backup.Dont Buy This Product
1190,5,if you can add an additional SSD then laptop will be awesome. otherwise compared to SSD the booting process is not fast but ok.
1191,5,Need to improve sound quality.
1192,4,"Read carefully.. My Experience was complicated just because of boot time i.e. on/off time was too long until I didn't go for updates but once I have done all updates... I am telling you guys...Maska..hai.. Maska..

Superb performance.. and look wise i liked it very much. I use to play GT racing without any lag..

My daughter is also happy for her online studies.

My suggestion is that don't think twice just go for it with Flipkart.

Thanks flipkart for very safe and on time delivery."
1193,5,Nice laptop and Ryzen 3 is a good processor for multi tasking... Design and color both are good. It's better to go with this HP laptop in this price segment...

1200,3,"Do not expect much :

1205,5,Cute little superior beautiful piece and performance just wow best deal .!
1206,5,Best in it's segment only shortcoming is they should provide it's Pen also......For regular use it is more than sufficient.. Otherwise it's a delicate darling need to be taken care of properly
1207,5,"Good laptop at this price range. Performance based also good but not for heavy work. For simple use like, MS office work, watching videos and surfing i3 is much enough. Handling multitask smoothly. Bit hevy than expected. Stylus pen not come with this product its vry disappointment. Battery - 4 to 5 hours (continues work) charging time - 0 to 100% took around 1 hour 20 minutes. Over all gud. Worth buying."

1209,5,Device is wonderful. I have been using windows 8/10 since its inception and how windows has improved over these years have been very unbelievable as windows updates are basically a disaster but windows experience in this laptop is very different as i am also using a mac parallel to windows for my personal multimedia needs but i have been using an HP 15 series for 5 years for my business accounting needs with built in windows 10 trust me after 5 years i switched to pavillion for the same and t...

It is pretty slick than what we were expecting, very much similar to high end hp laptops (spectre, elitebook, etc.). After a days use, can say I3 11th generation processor working just fine for normal laptop uses like content streaming, web browsing, etc."
1213,5,"The delivery was superfast by Flipkart. The packaging was very good. The laptop looks awesome, with its metallic aluminium finish, lovely island style backlit keyboard, great tab mode, strong hinge. The resolution is pretty good, boot up time low and touchscreen is responsive.

Over all initial experience is pretty good, will give a detailed review later."
1214,4,"Awesome and ultra stylish laptop in current generation,
.Display was excellent

1222,4,"The build and finish is great. The display is good but not great viewing angles try adjusting gamma for better viewing experience. It does need manual display callibration. The battery is 3-4 hrs with just coding, casual surfing and movie but one can manage as it comes with 65w cell for fast charging. The camera is straight out trash. No second thoughts, it could have been way better.

The positives are ofcourse that processing power coupled with ssd. It's light weight and feels great in usin..."
1223,5,Speed is good. Battery backup is usually 3-4 hours without internet. Their is no heatting issue.Display is LED type which is a modified LCD which has LED light diodes.Laptop is light weight and slim. Laptop has no backlit keyboard that makes me sad.Also camera is not good it is just 0.3 MP VGA which is very low.Laptop starts in 3-5 seconds.It has fingerprint sensor in trackpad square.
1224,4,"Every other spec meets the expectation but the camera. Webcams in general are pretty bad, but this one feels terrible. It's fine if you want for the sake of it. But, if webcam is an important criteria this is not the right choice. The product rates excellent in every other criteria."
1225,5,"Good laptop but the battery is also good but not better ,I am little not satisfied with battery ,but overall performance is good"
1226,4,"Ordered this laptop at 49k. Looks good, build quality is also decent, powerful processor, storage space is a little less, battery life is also decent 3 to 4 hrs.

Deducted one star for pretty average display quality and very poor webcam quality. I have read other reviews about poor webcam quality but it is even worse than I was expecting. My 25k HP laptop has a better display and webcam quality. I will install an external webcam because the camera quality is really pathetic.

1258,5,This is my second HP laptop purchase after 6 years since the first one. I wanted something light weight with upgraded additions to work from home.

1343,4,"4GB base ram is an absolute sin otherwise the product is pretty much flawless IMO.
You will find your system suffocated in terms of RAM if you open up 3 applications at once. I remedied that by installing an 8GB memory stick into the laptop. Now it works perfectly.

The product's nice with good display, a great body sporting a powerful Ryzen 5 hexa core processor which comes in handy while performing strenuous task on the laptop.
It also has performance modes to suit your various power needs but also keep an eye on the battery when using performance mode

I'm so happy with this product
Special Happy for this laptop with minimum price and with DVD drive however it's no show in Specification

1413,3,"I got this laptop primarily for my 4th grade kid and some home use.
Usage - Online classes on MS Teams, Word, Powerpoint. Youtube videos, browser based games and video calls.
Pros - Looks good. Screen size is fit for the purpose. Affordable for a tight budge. Scope of upgrading. Has all basic bells and whistles like HDMI slot, decent multimedia - webcam and speakers.
Cons - Already started getting slow. Teams app hangs atleast once in a day. Feeling the need to add to the existing 4 GB RAM...."
1414,5,"Booting time Is great after 1 Day out use
Battery is around 6 hours while normal use not gaming (medium brightness)
Pre installed Ms office
McAfee also (1 month)
Hanged for 2 times (when opended first) not after that
No warranty card
A charger
A laptop
Graphics are also good
Overall a great product
A must buy according to me"

And no, it's not for gaming, so it WILL lag if you put games in it. This laptop is for school, college, and work use.

Despite knowing that this was another China manufactured laptop (as is the competition) with Nokia label slapped on, went ahead and I don't regret it

Pros:

1. Very thin and light : After using an office laptop which weighed around 1.8 kg, was keen..."
1425,5,"Build quality of the laptop is really good. It boots up within seconds thanks to the fast SSD. Keyboard feels just right, but i just wish there was right Ctrl instead of a right alt.

Did observe some issue with displays. For people using windows 10, text could be either slightly small or big due to scaling issues.

The speakers are nice, but would have been even better if placed in the front. The sound sometimes gets dull if used on a softer surface.

For people who are curious, works reall..."

It is very rare to get a market disruptor in the field of laptop(s). But in this case I have found a hidden treasure. Nokia as a brand has been in the market for quite some time and with this new entrant, it is here to stay in the laptop market.

Just opening one remote machine and microsoft teams the memory shoots upto 95percent. Now planning to upgrade RAM to 8gb or 12. Other than that flipkart service, acer packaging, windows home activation, metal body, thin design are good about this purchase."
1452,4,"Its a nice laptop, light weight, good performing, fast charging and good battery life. Best part is very light weighted adapyer also. Only flaw is it says Microsoft office is free which is not true. I only got trial version for 10 days.rest is fine"

1464,4,"Got my first Macbook. I am really excited to explore this beautiful machine.
Initial impressions-:
- Build quality top notch full aluminum body.
- excellent look.
- Battery backup is not as claimed by company. In real world usage it is giving 6/8 hr back up.Here I am little bit disappointed.

I will put my full usage experience after 1 month."
1465,5,"Nice Keyboard. It is very compact. Nice for heavy-duty daily work.
The size has become smaller compared to previous models. Though I do not have much
complain about the current dimensions, the previous dimension of a 13-inch laptop was better.

Cooling Fan noise irritates sometimes. Without much load, the fans turn on and you cannot turn them off. If you really do not need the quad-core core version simply go with dual-core one. That should be enough for most of the daily work."
1466,5,Have received 2 days ago..Beautiful design..Working smoothly..A little bit of effort and time needed if you are switching from Windows but the experience have been pretty smooth so far. Need to invest in a few accessories like an USB hub or original software.
1467,5,"It's the best out there, if you're a student go for it without a doubt. It's awesome. Great Work Apple."
1468,4,It a amazing product but with one flaw which make it amazing and not absolutely amazing that is it's thermals. But not really a bumer with flew tweaks you can adjust it. Windows on bootcamp also works better than other windows laptop. Don't buy this if you are going to work in hot temperatures it requires a cool temperature.
1469,4,"Just 2 weeks using this. Design, display is great. Performance is good. Only cons i found is battery life. It discharges a bit quickly."
1470,5,Nice and amazing MacBook Air product Very Happy

1472,5,Wow. This is very nice product. My first macbook. Looks so nice. Very slim and light weight

1474,5,"The best purchase of my life.
I bought it for 77k (120Hz variant)
I am writing this review after using it moderate-heavy for one month.
After updating the drivers and software found in the included apps on the laptop, it runs extremely well.
I'm sure all other reviews have been read thoroughly, so I won't repeat them.
Some pointers which I have not read as much in the other reviews I will mention below.

1475,5,"Pros:
4600h better than 9750h in efficiency and multicore performance
Rx 5600m on par with 1660ti and even 2060
120hz screen with freesynch (60-120hz)
Temperatures can be controlled with Ryzen controller

Cons: Fans are loud. Cooling system is not that good. You have to use Ryzen controller to stabilize heat. Thanks to the efficiency of 4600h processor throttling is null.
Ram is 4*2gb which is a cons but Pro in its own way coz u r getting dual channel ram out of the box but limited to 8gb.

1476,4,"Performance at this price range is beast as compare to other. Build quilty is good but it is look better and solid when give metal frame. When you play games it becomes hot but company improve this by giving more air vents.
Overall laptop is best at this price range."
1477,5,"As dell named it indeed its a special edition. Nothing to add about CPU or GPU both are class apart from their rivals that's intel and nvidia which are being offered in this price category or even few grands higher.
What is not so special about the product is obviously the outer material choice and still unstable drivers.
Huge space for improvement is still there. Sometimes the thermals are around 80-85 but it fluctuates around 90-100 in between without pushing any extra frames.

1478,2,"I would not recommend this laptop to anyone who doesnt know much about laptop. The laptop has heating issues, shuts off mid game and you have to do multiple things before you start playing on it to reduce the temps. I would recommend going through reddit to get some honest reviews and things you need to do with this laptop."
1479,5,"It's a reasonably priced laptop with a ryzen 4000 cpu and an rx5600m GPU.

Things I am concerned about
1. The design of the lid: The bottom of the laptop screen is in the way of the air vents and hot air directly hits it and the screen surface become very hot. This could have been avoided with a better hinge design.
2. The screen even though 120 hz with AMD freesync, seems to lack colour accuracy I think. It's decent but most of the reviews that we find are of the 144 hz screen with great col..."
1480,4,"Great performance, good battery, great display, average design with average ventilation(hot air from inside hits on display which heats display), heavy in weight(~2.5kg) with bigger 240w charger which weights almost 1kg total of ~3.5kg,great keyboard and touchpad, good thermals with ryzen controller, good sound quality but no bass
Overall Great laptop with killer specs with low price tag"
1481,4,"It's a great laptop for the productivity and gaming performance available. Make sure to go to the dell official site and update bios and drivers for best performance.

The issues are there, mainly the laptop getting a little too hot at times but that can be managed by using ryzen controller and setting max temps to 85¬∞. The keyboard is also a little too small for my taste.

However, for gaming and everyday use, this is a great full amd laptop at a reasonable price in India, I would highly rec..."
1482,5,"The best laptop that you could get for this price range. The laptop is great for learning, media consumption, gaming ofcourse as well as machine learning, if you're into it.

Does it heat up? Like all gaming laptops, Yes. But nothing alarming. Mount it on a cooling pad if you want to. But it doesn't get very hot.

This laptop is a pure beast. With AMD CPU and GPU, it's a monster. Runs applications and AAA games butter smooth. I'm confident that it would run Cyberpunk 2077 on decent settings ..."
1483,5,"The product is absolutely worth buying. I don't think my review will add a lot of value to the already elaborate positive reviews. But I'll point point a few points I believe are important.

1) The battery life is not the best. It has a lot of heavy power consuming specs and don't expect more that 4-5 hours under normal usage.

2) It's a heavy unit. If you plan to be carrying it around very often then make sure you are up for some weight lifting. The power brick is also extremely large and he..."
1484,2,"Webcam quality is extremely poor. Build quality is poor. Keyboard is mediocre. If you have large hands like me than avoid this laptop. Always check product like laptop in person that you will be using on daily basis for personal and professional purposes before making purchase.

This laptop is not recommended for coding purposes. Keyboard is extremely fragile.

Laptop body is magnet for greasy smudges. Better opt for metal body laptop."
1485,4,The laptop is pretty descent for normal usage.Battery will disappoint you a liitle bit As i am a student so i usually have to attend 4 to 5 hours of online class but it goes around 4 and half hrs only...in normal usage. Not for any kind of gaming.. The display is mesmerizing.... it's really crispy clear and vibrant. Too lightweight. The blue color with shiny gradients looks awesome. Audio is quite consistent and clear ( no distortion even at high volume). But i must say this laptop is not for...
1486,5,"Very Good Product. nice build quality, nice compact design. Very fast and responsive."
1487,4,Flipkart packing was not good. Laptop box was kept in a large flipkart box without any bubble wrap or support and it was moving around inside - could have caused damage to laptop but luckily it was not damaged. The laptop is good. Software as promised. Office student version is free lifetime. Mcafee antivirus is free for 1yr. Finger print sensor works well. Overall good laptop.
1488,5,It runs very smoothly with a fast operation speed. One of the best option for people who work on regular basis and needs fast operations done. Did not used for gaming and other high end softwares but I feel it will not disappoint you.
1489,5,"It very good laptop for daily use , I am working from home and using this daily 9 to 10 hours and it's working fine, I have to charge one time only and battery backup is almost 9 to 10 hours according to my usage. Speed is also very good, one problem is you can not upgrade RAM in this laptop if required and always need to work under 8GB RAM. Overall it's good laptop. You will also get windows 10 and office 2019 license. I am using since last 1 month and working fine without any issue."

This is an excellent product for the money, something which will last for the coming 3-5 years for sure. The speed, primarily due to the SSD, is as expected. But the build quality is far superior to what it looks like in the pictures. Zero keyboard flex, beautiful color of the body and exceptionally sturdy frame. Further, its negligible weight makes you question how this rugged ..."

Battery life is great and weight is so less that you won't feel the extra burden while carrying it around.

Camera is pretty much garbage for those who have to do a lot web conferences.
Usage intended- browsing, office work, entertainment (speakers o..."
1498,5,"Loved it.
The laptop is extremely light, as promised.
The keyboard is very good , 1.4mm key travel is not something you'd get for 66k.
The performance is really good and the battery is also very good.
The only thing is the lack of skins, it attracts a lot of fingerprints, not an issue if you're someone who doesn't care about it or if you carry a microfiber cloth with you always.
A very good laptop, good value for money product.
Very much satisfied."
1499,4,"Pros:
- The laptop is extremely lightweight (<1 kg)
- The rose gold one gives a nice metallic luster.
- Screen can be opened with one hand. Not much flex in the screen.
- Fingerprint login

Cons:
- Pathetic touchpad. Freezes in the middle.
- Not sure about its reliability when one travels with a backpack and the laptop has to bear a significant (~3-4kg) load. My earlier laptop Lenovo u41-70 did fine.
- Power on/off screen is part of keypad. Not a deal breaker but a minor irritant.

3. Fans are good at keeping temps down

Pro's 1) RGB keyboard

Con's
1)it is not value for money like ""if predator comes with ryzen 7 5000 series it definitely a Beast now it is 8 cores 16 Threads in Intel not even beats the ryzen 7 4000series"".
2)near top of keyboard there is a huge heating issue.definately need to buy cooling pad

So guys please think twice before buying ..."
1531,4,"The Laptop is a masterpiece with stunnig design and premium looks.
The packing is awesome with a case to store it. The keyboard is customizable to different RGB colors via the Predator sense application.

Rendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060.
I7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers."

The laptop has decent overclocking headroom and the thermals are pretty good with vents at the bottom for intake. A cooling pad will keep it even cooler."

1712,5,"Nice very super product and nice performance
Battery backup nice"
1713,5,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå

1715,4,"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

CONS:-
1. The back camera is not so good. It's just o.k and up to mark.

3. The look is just satisfying l.
4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers."

I do use the phone as an average young adult, making frequent videocalls. This phone's battery is an ally for at least a day and a half.

CONS-
SECURITY-
There is a big security issue in this budget smartphones as you can see in above images the system apps like gallery,music player, sound recorder are asking permission to make and manage phone calls and without the permission the app doesn't work, what's the need of permission to manage phone calls in this basic apps, company should seriously roll out a update to fix this.

1811,4,"I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage.
PRONS:-
1. Front selfie camera is best
It's just 8MP but really gives resolution of 32 MP.
2. The phone is still not lagging and performance is good enough.
CONS:-
1. The back camera is not so good. It's just o.k and up to mark.
2. The resolution of phone is not so good.
3. The look is just satisfying l.
4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers."
1812,4,"The phone is really good at this range.
Main advantage is the battery , even continuous usage of it will make the full charge last atleast 2 days.
The charger is bit big , might not fit in every plug sockets.
It does take time to get fully charged but the awesome battery life covers it all.

Nearby share, realme share , bedtime mode , access to international data without a sim card - these are some features available in it.

I loved the camera, battery and display. It'd be better if the phone has a FHD+ display, but that's okay. The bigger battery, bigger screen and bigger camera satisfy me properly."
1815,5,"I'll not pretend to be an expert and review things as per their utility to me.
I don't play a single game on my phone, so don't need heavy GPU and clock numbers etc etc.
I do use the phone as an average young adult, making frequent videocalls. This phone's battery is an ally for at least a day and a half.

Earlier I was thinking to buy poco / Xiaomi smartphone (at the time of purchase I was using redmi 4 ) but then somewhere in my heart I wanted to get out of that buggy bloated MIUI with so many ads (as a Xiaomi user myself ) .

Rear Camera is good, produces decent pictures in daylight but there is some softness in the low light mode. Front camera also performs good in daylight mode....but in low light, it struggles to produce a decent picture. Camera AI is not up to the mark. It needs some upgradation.

Cons
1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021
2. Screen is LCD but quality is good
3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage
Pros
1.5G future proof with most of the band support

1897,4,"all i ll about this device is... a budget phone with great value for money features... although it has plastic back so fingerprints marks shows off but with a tpu case , its good & light weight to hold as well... so overall great job by realme üëçüèª"
1898,5,Extraordinary and my favorite phone in whole life.thus phone is very fast and it's performance is very smooth
1899,5,"Good budget 5g Smartphone.
Dimensity 700 it's excellent...(7nm)
Battery life is Good.
Camera it's not good as expected
Being an IPS Display it's Quite impressive & Smooth...

For My point of view Device is quite Good..at this price Range.."
1900,5,"Camera :- good photos , portrait is fabulous, AI is excellent
Battery :- very good
Display :- very good much like amoled
Performance :- fabulous performance
overall a good allrounder phone go for it"
1901,3,"If your priority is 5G then blindly go for this.. considering the price realme 8 5G is the cheapest 5G phone and also support lots of 5G bands...otherwise in this price range there are lots of better 4G smartphone available in the market...
Cons
1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021
2. Screen is LCD but quality is good
3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage
Pros
1.5G future proof with most of the band support
2. The phone tick most of the boxes considering price"
1902,5,Very very very good phone go for it.At this price range it is very good and nice phone...
1903,2,"Dimensity 700 is good at this price but not 30w charging.
Realme 8 has Super Amoled display on screen finger print but it has IPS LCD and side mount finger print. Realme 8 has Quad camera setup with 64 mp sensor it has tripal cameras with 48mp main sensor. Realme Focus on only 5G and nothing on other features. Now realme become costly like other smartphone company"
1904,5,"It's a nice gadget, fast. Camera good, rear and front, though rear needs some optimisations. Look is good. Battery for long term. After a day 35%. Separate SD card slot. 128gb storage. Charging takes little time. 5G. Brightness more than enough to use the phone directly under the sun. Overall a good all rounder phone for the price."
1905,4,"I would recommend to go for 4G model, a lot better display and camera, if 5G is the only concern, this one is also a good offering."
1906,3,"Battery is superb but camera and display doesnt feeel good as we accpect and sad for gamer pubg only SMOoTH ULTRA 30fps So your gun recoil ll not be smooth as

Worst ram management
Worst cameras (pathetic in artificial light)
Inspite of bigger display its a 720p display, pixels are visible and annoying
Display colours are faded
Using data we can watch on 480p videos and on WiFi 720p
Gaming like pubg and free fire are running fine only in low settings
Worst loudspeaker

IN MY OPINION IT IS BEST IN BEST BUDGET PHONE AS COMPARE TO XIAOMI OR REALME .

I ALSO TAKE SPEED TEST B/W INFINIX SMART 4 PLUS VS REALME C11

1996,3,"At price range its a very good specs
But after buying no ram management, very worst front speaker, good display, big screen size, good battery

I am absolutely impressed with this phone..Its Dts speaker amazing and main thing is thats its given on phone front on top..where ideally speaker must have..

1998,2,"Not recommended phone.. My review after using it for a week..

Pros:

Bigger display
Best battery backup ( at least 2 days)
customised rom


Cons:

Worst ram management
Worst cameras (pathetic in artificial light)
Inspite of bigger display its a 720p display, pixels are visible and annoying
Display colours are faded
Using data we can watch on 480p videos and on WiFi 720p
Gaming like pubg and free fire are running fine only in low settings
Worst loudspeaker

Verdict

Its the best mobile only..."

On hand feel: yes this phone is a bit heavy. It almost 300grm including case and temper glass. Though it's not any issue for me.

Display: earlier I used 60hz LCD display. Now this is something extra smooth! Display is big, colors are crispy, brightness is good for normal use unless you using it under harsh sunlight.

2) Phone is slightly heavy.
3) camera is awesome you will love it
4) Sound quality is too good with high pitch, so when you play a song with full volume your phone may be vibrate due to double speaker.

Front camera is great... And I'm not sure if this fault is only in my phone but WiFi is not connecting properly... Most of the time, WiFi lacks in my phone...
I bought this phone for online classes, and it works well...

2012,5,"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way."

2014,4,To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.

2040,5,Nice phone with affordable price. Battery very powerful. Charges quick. If someone looking for an affordable mobile with loaded features this is the one. Oppo all the way.
2041,3,"If you really want a fast charging phone, this one is not for you. Fast charging phones are Vooc based and above 20W. Oppo A53 (128G) is taking around 3hrs to fully charge. Rest all features are okayish in all brands today like Mi, Oppo, Realme. I bought a Moto one action last year (128G) and cheaper than this but trust me Moto is better compare to this Oppo A53 in terms of app responsiveness and AI."

Camera perfectly ok, hd display and 64gb rom"
2052,5,"Nice very super product and nice performance
Battery backup nice"
2053,5,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå
2054,5,"Nice mobile, good battery backup, camera satisfactory, display is awesome, sound quality satisfactory, nice internet speed. Best mobile at this range. Highly recommended"
2055,4,"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

There is over brightness on display..."
2084,5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage.

2091,5,It is best value for money mobile and it's camera üì∏ is awesome . Battery back up is very good and it's work very smooth
2092,3,"Camera is some what satisfactory. Phone is good only for normal use. Ram doesn't supporting properly when we use apps or games of more than 600mb , like pubg, free fire etc. Faster charging and charging is getting down very very slowly.

Never and ever buy 2G or 3G phones, Redmi 9 prime is really excellent when compared to Redmi 8A dual, it's some high price but it's really good."
2093,5,Due to the Curved finish and plastic back the mobile has very good grip and feels good for single hand use. The rear camera performs at very high refreshing rate but the front camera is not as good as rear and the depth sensor is ok. The display is ok and the performance of the mobile is pretty much better for this pricing
2094,4,"The camera is not that good . Everything else is just fine according to the price . Nice built quality , looks , display , battery , os , processor . Good for lite usage ."
2095,5,"Good mobile in this price for a normal user r for a fresher,

Note : Sometime its look like Edge phone"
2105,5,"THIS PHONE IS BEST FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICIAL WORK . I CONTINUEOUSLY PLAYING VIDEOS AND GAMING 18 HOUR'S AFTER THAT IT SWITCH OFF.

IN MY OPINION IT IS BEST IN BEST BUDGET PHONE AS COMPARE TO XIAOMI OR REALME .

I ALSO TAKE SPEED TEST B/W INFINIX SMART 4 PLUS VS REALME C11
RESULT - INFINIX IS SMOOTH IN OPENING THE APPS BUT IN REALME C11 APPS ARE OPEN LATE .

üíØ SATISFYING PRODUCT"
2106,3,"At price range its a very good specs
But after buying no ram management, very worst front speaker, good display, big screen size, good battery
Gaming on this device like pubg is ok @20fps
Either if ur not a gamer and a single app user choose this device or go to realme c3"
2107,5,"Its true #AbRuknaNahi...GOOD ONE
I am absolutely impressed with this phone..Its Dts speaker amazing and main thing is thats its given on phone front on top..where ideally speaker must have..
Another interesting thing excellent display, phone texture with back tough cover, camera, 3+32 all with reasonable price.. Thanks to Team INFINIX????
and Thank you to Seller for proper packing???
most thankfull to Flipkart team(Ekart logistics team) for before expected time delivery.?????"
2108,2,"Not recommended phone.. My review after using it for a week..

Pros:

Bigger display
Best battery backup ( at least 2 days)
customised rom


Cons:

Worst ram management
Worst cameras (pathetic in artificial light)
Inspite of bigger display its a 720p display, pixels are visible and annoying
Display colours are faded
Using data we can watch on 480p videos and on WiFi 720p
Gaming like pubg and free fire are running fine only in low settings
Worst loudspeaker

Verdict

Its the best mobile only..."

2113,1,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display..."
2114,5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ..."
2115,5,"Pros:-
Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT
Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation.

Those who want to give their parents a new smartphone for the very first time, blindly go for it. 2 gb ram is enough for making video calls or watching youtube without any interruptions. Battery capacity is more than required. Camera is above average level, overall it's a good choice for those who aren't that much proficient in using smartphones."
2206,5,"A perfect budget friendly mobile for my mother. Camera is good according to the price, battery was great 2 days backup of moderate use but charging is soow but that's manageable, screen is big but hd+ resolution so its ok at this price."
2207,2,"Camera : 0.5/5 (quality is too bad )
Battery : 4.5/5
Speaker/Call hearing: Sound/voice is low 2/5
Touch - fair 4/5
handy: 3/4
Interface: OK types
Build: 5/5 good fit and finish


Over ALL it just a smartphone used to check/do emails/surf sites, if you are camera lover. DON'T Buy it, if just need a phone for calling and basic work /emails/whatsapp call internet etc. can buy.
My take choose MI/ Real me instead in this price tags !!!"
2208,5,"Good camera but,since zoom there is not satisfied
Value of money
Nice product i ever seen 1 day fast delivery by flipkart
Android 10 support good for normal gaming but high gamers not buy it.."
2209,5,"Good budget 5g Smartphone.
Dimensity 700 it's excellent...(7nm)
Battery life is Good.
Camera it's not good as expected
Being an IPS Display it's Quite impressive & Smooth...

For My point of view Device is quite Good..at this price Range.."
2210,5,"Camera :- good photos , portrait is fabulous, AI is excellent
Battery :- very good
Display :- very good much like amoled
Performance :- fabulous performance
overall a good allrounder phone go for it"
2211,3,"If your priority is 5G then blindly go for this.. considering the price realme 8 5G is the cheapest 5G phone and also support lots of 5G bands...otherwise in this price range there are lots of better 4G smartphone available in the market...
Cons
1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021
2. Screen is LCD but quality is good
3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage
Pros
1.5G future proof with most of the band support
2. The phone tick most of the boxes considering price"
2212,5,Very very very good phone go for it.At this price range it is very good and nice phone...
2213,2,"Dimensity 700 is good at this price but not 30w charging.
Realme 8 has Super Amoled display on screen finger print but it has IPS LCD and side mount finger print. Realme 8 has Quad camera setup with 64 mp sensor it has tripal cameras with 48mp main sensor. Realme Focus on only 5G and nothing on other features. Now realme become costly like other smartphone company"
2214,5,"It's a nice gadget, fast. Camera good, rear and front, though rear needs some optimisations. Look is good. Battery for long term. After a day 35%. Separate SD card slot. 128gb storage. Charging takes little time. 5G. Brightness more than enough to use the phone directly under the sun. Overall a good all rounder phone for the price."
2215,4,"I would recommend to go for 4G model, a lot better display and camera, if 5G is the only concern, this one is also a good offering."
2216,3,"Battery is superb but camera and display doesnt feeel good as we accpect and sad for gamer pubg only SMOoTH ULTRA 30fps So your gun recoil ll not be smooth as

Camera perfectly ok, hd display and 64gb rom"
2292,5,"Nice very super product and nice performance
Battery backup nice"
2293,5,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå

2295,4,"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

And you will love it's Blade silver colour it looks very premium. They should give 64 MP camera at rear as 48 MP is available is lesser price range. But the front camera is very good.

2305,4,"I really like the display. It is silky smooth and it has gaming mode which gives better performance.
I really like the realme ui. But I would have been better if Android 11. The camera needs lot of improvement. It saturates all images. None of the images I have uploaded have original colors. It is a performance beast and a future proof 5g phone. But camera needs lot of improvement."
2306,5,"Excellent phone with all its features.Excellent camera.Excellent Refresh rate with 120Hz .the wonderful Performance of
800u processor. I give the rate for this phone 5 stars. As the price rate of this phone not good with Ram 64GB. They need to provide ram at least provide 6 GB Rom and 128 Gb Ram At this Price."

Battery back up too bad, not up to 6000 mah. Feels like 4000 mah battery capacity. Charging time taking up to Two and a half hours which is not good while it's a fast charger.
Camera is also bad. Not up to the mark."
2325,5,"Best quality in this budget. I am a gamer. I play lots of games. I will prefer that you can buy it. Battery backup is very good. It can easily do 7 hours non stop gaming. You can play Free Fire, COD is ultra graphics in this phone. That's it for today, bye bye. Thanks Redmi and Flipkart."

It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
Screen size is good
Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.

Design and build: Fits well in hand and it's side mounted finger print scanners ls also placed in an optimal location. A simple plastic back with curved edges. Feels little heavy.

Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone"
2340,5,"This smartphone is very good in camera and battery
And value for money from Samsung with clean and smooth
Ui and good battery life also"
2341,5,"Best mobile for in this price range, Battery backup is highlight. Better go with this mobile in budget category from best brand. Absolutely perfect mobile."
2342,5,"It's fantastic phone actually .
Especially battery backup is very good upto 2days with a single charge..
it's nearly 1/4 kg..
Anyway best phone under 12k"
2343,1,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display..."
2344,5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ..."
2345,5,"Pros:-
Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT
Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation.
Samsung brand is trust. Phone is Durable and service centre are very helpful
This is myth exynos are not good. Trust me, in real life in doesnt matter until and unless you do heavy gaming at very high..."

2348,5,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.
2349,5,"Very big screen and little bulky. But very good mobile.
Any how we make it bulky by putting a fancy case. But screen is so big and it might need 2 hands.

Whatever, stock Android, awesome price range, good features. Definitely value for money.

Ordered 2 more after seeing first one."
2350,4,"Performance wise great but if you are coming from a miui background to this stock android experience, obviously there is no ads but some features i.e. lock screen, app lock, internet speed meter, floating window is not there.
Camera is quite good and gives natural colour ( not a colour saturated one) and the best part us image size is less.
Battery performance is good.
This not a amoled display.
There is no notification light."
2351,5,"You will fall in love with how the phone works literally !!
Performance is butter smooth, internet is blazing fast, downloads and installs are pretty quick.
Camera is good you'll just need to get used to clicking pictures with moto because it requires some practice.
A lil bit heavy but you'll get used to it in a day and after all it is power packed so you won't mind it much.
Definitely go for it, it's a perfect phone with clean UI.
Lots of Love to Moto for this !!"
2352,5,"The G40 seems to be a beautiful looking phone (Metallic Grey) and I like the big screen size. The weight doesn't bother me at all. It has better connectivity both for phone calls and internet.
Connected really quickly to my Car Bluetooth as well. Since I moved from the Moto Z Play to this phone, this was a super upgrade in terms of speed and memory space.

The data migration / transfer was smooth between both these phones except for the fact that I am still facing issues restoring my WhatsAp..."
2353,5,"A really good performing phone with a good display
Camera could be better. But can't really complain in this price range.

But the best thing is the amazing fluidity of stock android and 120 hz display with a capable performing chip."
2354,5,"Anyone who is hesitating bcz of the weight beleive me I also have the tension about the weight but when I unboxed and took it in my hand I was totally surprised (also to be mentioned that I'm moving from a 5 inches phone) , it is lighter and handy than I expected.

2355,5,"This is my first moto phone.. writing this detailed review after a week time of usage. New details covered here for your better understanding.

Currently i'm having realme 7 (8gb+128gb) which was bought 7 months back. Realme 7 is good in features but phone call quality , bluetooth call quality is not good and somewhat i'm not satisfied with that phone. Redmi Note 10 pro also was in list but heard that lot of display issues, hanging, bloatware and inferior quality. Hence i decided to go wit..."
2356,5,"Adding this comment after 4 days of heavy use
First thing to mention is the battery backup. Lasted for 3 days without gaming.

Camera is good enough and is stable. If you're looking for a better camera, go for G60, has the same specs but 108mp camera. Rest is the same

Speakers are working nice at high volumes and have a good pitch to it.

Ui is stock android 11 with latest updates installed. It is pretty smooth and free of bloatware which is not the case with poco and mi phones. But if you'r..."
2357,4,"Display is good
Camera sensor is good but the camra software and optimisation is worst
Use GCAM to take better images
Performance top notch
Bettry excellent easily 8 hours of screen on time
Speaker is good but there is some distortion at max volume"
2358,5,"Amazing phone. Stock android is super smooth, top line performance, battery backup is huge. Front camera flash at this price is also cherry on the cake. Rarely you would get all this amazing feature combo at this price point.

Only drawback is lack of NFC, but it's not a deal breaker at all.

Definitely go for this. This phone will also last long as it's durable both hardware and software wise... In love with the phone."
2359,5,"Good feature phone, i prefer to free from the addiction to smartphones. I am fully satisfied. 2000 contact memory is impressive. I am loving it."

Overall it's worth purchasing"
2363,4,"Decent phone for calls, long lasting battery life. I'm using this phone to receive calls, texts. Standby time is really good. Got this phone 12 days ago, and charged fully first time, and yet to charge again, battery is still almost 15% around, which will last 2 days more. If you lookin for a phone as secondary phone for calls, this is the best buy."

Speed, display working fine. I don't know why Samsung pass is not in my phone. Only problem that I found is rate was decreased in other website just after my phone was delivered.

Cons: I purchased 64 GB Samsung Micro SD card from Flipkart as well. For some reason it does not fit in the slot properly, it protrudes at one end. Any ways we managed to get it in by squeezing it and applying pressure while inserting it into the slot. Still can't image why wouldn't Samsung phone fit Samsung memory card properly :-) Lol.

2381,5,this is all you get for a tiny budget phone like this one. the sound quality and call quality is quite good on this phone. the best part is the battery back-up on this phone. Till now no issue with this phone although i have used for only about a month so far. Not too sure how good it will function in the future.
2382,5,"Today, 3rd Aug, 2020, I received the mobile phone. I am very happy with the phone. it is really low price but good feature phone. Battery is 1750 mah which is more than enough for a feature phone. Another remarkablefeature of this phone is it has inbuilt sound amplifier, that's why loudly and clearly music can be listened. This is purely indian origin phone. Feeling proud to be an Indian. Thank you Lava international."

2391,3,"If you really want a fast charging phone, this one is not for you. Fast charging phones are Vooc based and above 20W. Oppo A53 (128G) is taking around 3hrs to fully charge. Rest all features are okayish in all brands today like Mi, Oppo, Realme. I bought a Moto one action last year (128G) and cheaper than this but trust me Moto is better compare to this Oppo A53 in terms of app responsiveness and AI."

I became late to open the product and found out the battery is not working properly and gets switched off within 4 hours. These phones are supposed to be battery efficient. As its the 8th days I cant claim a replacement. Plus while opening I felt someone had already used and returned this product."

2447,1,"I bought the phone a week ago. Overall experience is just bad. Phone is slow even after 8GB RAM. 720g is not at all a good processor.. This phone has 60hz display.. In this price. You can get a better phone.. Go with Xiaomi..or OPPO
Camera is 108MP but isn't good at all. It just makes you white.. Please don't buy it. A humble request"
2448,4,"Screen refresh rate(60 fps) is very low as compared to current running smartphones in market(90-120 fps). Other smartphones even with same refresh rate(60 fps) also looks faster like OnePlus 6 (3 years old model -60 fps).
OnePlus is any day better than this. If you can increase your budget from 20-22k to 25k than please take OnePlus Nord. You will get value for money."

2571,5,"I've been using this phone for about 2 months... It's really great but it still needs a little bit improvement in camera, and display...And the battery performance is unbeatable... Front camera is great... And I'm not sure if this fault is only in my phone but WiFi is not connecting properly... Most of the time, WiFi lacks in my phone...
I bought this phone for online classes, and it works well...

FYI: If you need a phone for daily use with awesome battery, then you can go with this...

2572,5,"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way."
2573,5,"Very nice phone, performance is excellent,, I see the phone i am quite because it's very good product and good delivery I love this‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
2574,4,To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.

Stock Android is amazing, very clean and brilliant user interface
Battery life is good
Not a hardcore gamer, but device performs well and haven't found any heating issues yet
Motos gestures are fun to use
Refresh rate of 120Hz can drain battery a bit but experience is very fluid and smooth

Cons:

2730,4,"it's a basic phone you can ask for from a reliable company. Nokia was the king then. but still I would say that it doesn't feel the way Nokia phones used too. The typing isn't smooth as it used to be. rest all its good. Talking about the games it just snake. rest is paid. Charging and the aux port is not surfaced with the body so dust and water would easily find there way in. It supports the full big SIM card, not the nano or micro ones. Also the battery case isn't that easy to open."

The Good
+ Feels quite good to hold
+ Body is well built
+ Body is not scratchy since its matte finish
+ The Nokia UI

The bad
- Voice leakage is a main concern. The phone has only one speaker which faces back side, So when you are talking you are actually hearing from the back side than front side which is quite irky. Also this makes things audible to ppl around well rather than you.

- The ringer volume is not really good l..."

The mobile is good and the model review had been done on YouTube to get it. But I felt that the Amoled screen is not that much good when compared to the Samsung A51 or 71 series but for this costings, the screen quality is okay. I had got 8GB Ram with 128GB storage variant."
2794,5,"Awesome mobile,thanks to flipkart for quick delivery.
Smooth display, battery backup is really outstanding, awesome ram performance,but according to me camera is not good.Overall good mobile with reasonable cost.And thanks to realme for the launch of realme8........"
2795,4,"everything is ok , camera is nice ,bt when we play games ,the device is getting hotter soon ,and when we charge the phone it's charger and phone both becomes much hot , look was extreme good of this device"
2796,3,"Everything else is decent enough except these following two points:
1. Amoled screen seems like a hoax, utterly disappointed. Compared it with Realme 6 (not an Amoled), I didn't find any difference in quality. If MultiMedia viewing experience is one the more important things on your priority list, then you should have second thoughts about buying it.
2. Disappointed by Camera (both, but particularly the front one). Not even an ounce of originality in the selfies. In dimmer light surroundings,..."
2797,3,"I am using 8GB RAM mobile & reviewing after 10 days usage.

Received two OTA updates related to Camera, still Camera is average. Especially for video recording, it is below average.

Disappointed with the sound system as it doesn't produce clear sounds.

We cannot uninstall inbuilt app, Finshell Pay.

Except these everything is fine.

The things I liked in this mobile are it's battery capacity & charging speed. For normal usage, we can use it about more than one day easily. We can charge it ..."

brave investment as a long term especially in terms of durability and reflective design ,storage ( but if you don't want durability ) ,

2804,3,"Nothing special as compared to predesor realms 7 accept super amoled display and in display fingerprint scanner but refresh rate is been downgraded. The back panel in fingerprint and dust magnet. Mono speaker but still produces decent output. phone is getting heated after camera uses this is quite unusual. Network reception is fine. Camera is ok ok..the other 2 lenses are just to make it quad camera setup.

2808,5,A great phone.The battery drain a little faster but I think it resolve with a few updates.Display is good but if it had 90hz fast refresh rate it would be good.In display fingerprint is quite fast.Faster than realme 8 pro!!Performance is top notch.I have the 4gb version and I played call of duty at the highest settings and I haven't seen any frame drops.Camera is good but the camera was better in realme 7.I haven't seen the Tilt Shift mode yet but we will get it with updates.Charging is fast....

Overall a decent product with good in-hand feel and good charging speed
Got the phone for my father, he seemed to have liked it a lot... specially the Display is bright with good customisations
At this price point if camera is not your primary requirement I think it's a decent purchase."

Moreover, Flipkart delivery executive has delivered the product much earlier before the scheduled date."
2831,5,Very nice phone
2832,3,I have bough it for my amma based on the previous purchase of a Lava features phone. Find it good with clear display but my amma find it little bit difficult to operate. If the phones are designed keeping in mind of the elders it will be appreciated very much.

Why you should buy:-

It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
Screen size is good
Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.

Design and build: Fits well in hand and it's side mounted finger print scanners ls also placed in an optimal location. A simple plastic back with curved edges. Feels little heavy.

Display: Looks stunning with great colours and balanced and adaptive brightness. It's Full HD+ display is Ideal for watching videos. 60Hz refresh rate is good considering the budget but as I shifted from high end one plu..."
2859,3,"Loved the Color
Good Finish
It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned.
Display is very dull
Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing
Cam is great for this price point
Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera
128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake
Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization..
90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience."
2860,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display.
The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag.
The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight.
I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
2861,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
2862,5,"Mobile is very good and performance
I gifted my sister on her birthday
She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart"
2863,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
2864,4,"Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user.
Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful.
90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother.
Battery lasts long enough to not bother you.
And moto unique features are like cherry on the top.
You can go for it without even thinking twice."
2865,4,"Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance.
Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better

1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery.

3. No 4K video recording.
4. Max display brightness is pretty weak."
2868,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...

2871,5,"I've been using this phone for about 2 months... It's really great but it still needs a little bit improvement in camera, and display...And the battery performance is unbeatable... Front camera is great... And I'm not sure if this fault is only in my phone but WiFi is not connecting properly... Most of the time, WiFi lacks in my phone...

2872,5,"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way."

2874,4,To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.

Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery,
Comes to the products, when I opened and setting up, phone used to hanged sometimes but after update I think it will be ok,
it comes with latest sd 678 so i dont have much idea about it but i think it's not good for gaming. Camera is ok both front and back. Battery is 5000mah but draining quite faster so it feels like 4000 mah. But it's has 33w fast charger so it will take around 1hour to full.

Redmi note 10 is not compatible for gamers. ..."

3182,5,"Hi all,
As I have bought Poco M2 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.
I would give you my honest experience..
I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone,
1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs.
2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than ..."
3183,4,SUPERB PHONE WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE..I ALWAYS PREFER POCO FOR HIS BETTER PERFORMANCE THEN OTHER PHONES....
3184,5,"I am giving review after one month of use.
This phn is awsme ,camera is good , battery backup mind-blowing 1 day battery backup after hard use . charging time 1 hr 10mins, PUBG play super smooth nthng hang.

3185,4,"This phone comes with decent specifications....And the audio output is pretty good. One who is looking for best camera then you should not buy this..though it has a samsung isocell camera sensor..it struggles a lot while focusing...Redmi note 7 pro even came with sony sensor...then i don't know why the upcoming phones are coming with samsung sensor
While coming to the battery part...it gives a excellent battery backup..Screen On time would be 9.5hrs max .
Display is good..
I appreciate this p..."

1)In hand Feel 8/10
2)Battery 9/10
3)Gaming 8/10 -- Good Performs Bcz Of SD-720G You Can Play PUBGI Without Any Lags And No Heating Issue While Heavy Used.
4)Look 10/10
5)Camera 8/10

I have added some night mode,macro mode,pro mode pic's so you can see images ... and primary camera works good compare to redmi note 9 pro"

OnePlus is any day better than this. If you can increase your budget from 20-22k to 25k than please take OnePlus Nord. You will get value for money."

If I am lucky enough to get even 1-2 of them to match with the ones that will be launched in India(whenever it comes), then it will turn out to a great buy. Phone gets slightly warm (warm not hot) when using personal hotspot, but I feel that's expected. Realme UI experience is also good. Looking forward for a similar performance after Android 11 update."

Someone who normally uses their phone for at least 3 to 5 years this is a good option. 5G might be rolled out in a year or so and this phone will get one covered for 5G connectivity as it supports up to five different 5G bands which is the second best after Moto G 5G at present.

3300,5,"This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.

Best features with stunning looks & performance.

Battery life is very good..."
3301,5,"Who all loves older size i.e., 4.7 inch type should definitely go for this. Nothing is better than XR, XS or 11. Best for price and usage."
3302,4,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time. Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.
3303,4,"As always compact and handy ... with good image stability
4K gives amazing experience
Battery capacity is little poor ..
it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget..
4/5 my rating"
3304,4,"Totally worth the price if:

- you are a iOS fan
- like compact phone
- want to switch from android to iPhone
- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)
- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)
- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)

1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ..."
3307,4,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.

The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."
3308,4,"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.

Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you..."

3358,5,"A solid buy.
I had bought the poco x3 too with this phone and between the two, I genuinely feel the realme is better.

The software is almost stock with no ads( at least not yet ;p) and it even uses the google phone and messaging apps.

The amoled screen is perfect and in my opinion better than the 120hz lcd on the poco (because the poco keeps aggressively throttling its refresh rate to save battery)

The display can get pretty dim thanks to DC dimming and outdoor visibility is also p..."

1. Battery backup is really good. It almost takes one and a half day to charge it again. Fast charging as well.

2. Display's look and feel is good as well.

4. Video quality is really good I must say.

The Good
+ Feels quite good to hold
+ Body is well built
+ Body is not scratchy since its matte finish
+ The Nokia UI

The bad
- Voice leakage is a main concern. The phone has only one speaker which faces back side, So when you are talking you are actually hearing from the back side than front side which is quite irky. Also this makes things audible to ppl around well rather than you.

- The ringer volume is not really good l..."

This phone gives a really good battery backup if your a normal users like me , but first things first this is not a gaming phone , you can play pubg and you will find lags even if it's not in hd graphics.

other brand phones in the price range are very good

As this phone is game centric, but doesn't mean one should play games only. Generic user can use that power to finish daily tasks quicker + 800 series survive longer than mid segment SoC's due to premium cores and materials used. Cameras are good not that bad but don't expect much. Attached some pictures before complete switch.

I have switched from Poco F1 to X3 Pro. So, similar balance with good upgrades.

During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality.
Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon."

One down grade is macro is not good..

Audio:
Nice sound output from speaker as well as headphone..

Screen quality is good..too much colourful.. but The Absence of HDR feels while content watching... clarity is not up to the mark..

Battery backup is decent, 6 hours usage consumed 56% battery... so SOT can be calculated as 8.5 hours -9 hours...

Overall a good package..."

Overall a value for money device with super Amoled...
3678,4,"Display:
- Best while watching media content
- But for normal use, there is minor blue tint like (LCD) especially for white colour which can be fixed through software update (but most people don't care)
- Overall satisfied

Realme UI:
- Less bloatware, simple UI
- Comes with Android 11
- I like that they were using Google phone , contacts & messaging app. many people don't like this but I liked it bcoz of privacy concerns I have with the old realme UI apps
- UI can be improved in the App Draw..."

I would refer this phone becoz of its simplicity in user interface . Also for its big battery and 120 hz refresh rate. With the specs in this phone alone u won't get any other phone with this price range. Seriously just go for it. Just becoz it doesn't have a amoled display, it is criticised a lot.

1)Battery is 6000 mah, don't think it goes for 2days for heavy user. It's only 1 day & for light user it may taken 2-3 days.
2) Phone is slightly heavy.
3) camera is awesome you will love it
4) Sound quality is too good with high pitch, so when you play a song with full volume your phone may be vibrate due to double speaker.

Battery life is good
Not a hardcore gamer, but device performs well and haven't found any heating issues yet
Motos gestures are fun to use
Refresh rate of 120Hz can drain battery a bit but experience is very fluid and smooth

Cons:
6000mah battery results in a heavy phone
Moto G40 fusion might be a better option as cameras aren't that much different
20W charger sometimes feel quite slow

Pros:
1) Massive battery backup (Check the screenshot). Mine has 56% juice left and I had charged it 2 days ago with one SIM installed and WIFI connected continuously.

3) Performance is super smooth and I have kept 120hz refresh rate for screen

The display is amazing and the built quality is superb. All the close up shots from the rear camera are great and the front cam is also good.
The audio quality is out of this world!!
The phone feels very light considering the 6000mah battery
Although i feel the rear cam isn't upto the mark.
But overall Motorola has done a great job!"

Without any doubt go for it!

I love moto gesture that makes you to handle this phone with one hand. In a single sentence - very user friendly.

Excellent stock android experience - that makes user interface light, without any ads and bloatware.

Good battery backup - If you will keep the refresh rate in auto and continue with general work like surfing, watch videos, attend calls, social media then you will get 1 to 1.5 days easily.

The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.

Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days.
The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."

After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
4071,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
4072,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
4073,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
4074,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
4075,4,"Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level.
Thank you for such an amazing product."
4076,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.

Pros
1. Looks good and stylish
2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app
3. Vibration with notification is very strong

Cons
1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes
2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi
3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
4077,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
4078,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.

The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."

Its suffice to say that the extra RAM does wonders to the fluidity of the OS with once in a blue moon glitch.

I strongly recommend this watch as this price point. Was not sure to buy Aqfit or Gonoise Colorfit pro. So after research I found that Aqfit has bigger screen size and dual color strap.

4278,5,"Best in this price range. Over all budget friendly.

Here I'm giving my over all experience with AQFit W8 Smartwatch :

Look is nice & decent , Strap is soft
Light in weight to wear
Bluetooth connectivity is fast & good
Nice downloadable watch faces
Nice applications integration
Notification display is good
Alert vibration is good.
Battery charging good
It has our own image as watch face
Phone Alerts are good , can read messages well
Sunlight legibility ok"

4451,4,"i bought this for my Amazfit Verge Smartwatch....

the best part of this product is the installation.
its very satisfying as they give so many things with this.
wet wipe, dry wipe, dust remover sticker, cleaning cloth, additional sticker strip to place the screen guard, a small suction cup etc.
the packaging is very premium.

however installation needs to be done very precisely. the suction cup is very useful as i ended up with wrong placement of the screen guard but then i pulled it up with ..."

4453,5,"This is a good watch and functions well for the fitness related features ... sync with iPhone is a bit difficult but android sync and features may be good
You can buy this if you are looking for a decent watch with reasonable features"

Under the sunlight screen becomes little shiny
So the visibility is not that good.
Heart rate sensor takes more time than usual
Charging dock is very big.

4458,1,This product is a dump from huami and it is frequently crashing and not synced with the phone all time. i was totally unsatisfied with this product. Only thing i convinced is the amoled display. But it is totally waste of money to spend 10k for amoled display watch. Recently i am facing battery drain issue (within 13hrs it has almost drained to 12%). Dont expect any smartness in this watch.
4459,1,the watch worked okay for first day but after that the battery started to drain out very fast then the watch stopped giving me notifications and I even had to factory reset it 3 time to function properly

5111,5,"Good product by Dell and Flipkart. It has both hdmi and vga port, so you can connect from laptop using hdmi for a second screen. Super buildup and screen resolution is good for official work."
5112,4,Its a very good product... Good build quality.. Both VGA input and HDMI input works perfect.. Its a good choice.. as we could even use it as a TV screen with the HDMI input.. Really satisfied with the monitor and the delivery of flipkart...
5113,5,Great product from Dell . It's budget friendly and served the purpose very well as of now. You can go and buy . It comes with HDMI cable and VGA cable. Good packing from Flipkart.
5114,4,"This is a great monitor , very clear pictures & nice performance.
Buttons for varied functions @ right hand side are easy accessible. I am completely satisfied by this product. Thank you Flipkart üëç"

However the Power Plug socket is similar to The Microwen socket, so ensure that before you have ordered you have the socket or a adaptor at your workstation /desk"
5123,1,"I have returned this product since it's not working properly, but pick up is cancelled suddenly at last time.
I contact support team but they are saying policy date closed and they're not taking return this product, best don't prefer this product and the Flipkart also. they are cheating innocent people's."
5124,3,Its good.. But the delivery guys were handling it as if its football.
5125,5,Its very good. Must Buy. 24 inch is very comfortable for eyes.
5126,4,Exlent
5127,1,Very worst Monitor...HD video not supported this Monitor don't buy this....Very disappointed me
5128,5,Tremendous Monitor
5129,5,The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works. It has speakers but they are very tiny and not useful but it has audio output for attaching external speakers.
5130,4,"BenQ 22inch panel monitor looks and work great, easy to assemble. Packaged in very protective manner, deliver was good. Much satisfied with this purchase.
Down side: Volume is considerable low. Power input cord is large 3 pin which generally seen with A/C, refrigerators and washing machines. Its uncommon in household we have many of such sockets at right spot."
5131,5,"It's been a month, i m using the monitor, its working very well, the IPS panel is really nice, viewing angles, colour, sharpness everything is good. Reading, browsing, watching YouTube videos can be done smoothly. Speaker volume is too low but i don't really need them.
What i didn't like about the monitor is that it takes almost 5 seconds to turn on.
Other than that its amazing so i'm rating 5 starts wanted to rate 4.75 but there's no option, so 5 it is."
5132,5,Good Colors. Value For Money Product.
5133,5,fabulous product
5134,4,Good
5135,1,Nowhere in the description or on the box it mentions that 16A sized 3pin cable is included with monitor. That size is used for Fridge/Microwave etc and doesn't fit in a regular 3 pin socket. Can not use this monitor without buying a convertor now. Highly disappointing that this is not mentioned in any of the product details.
5136,4,"After using for one day, I can say this monitor is fine but you have purchase a 6 Amp power cable seperately around Rs120, because the power pable provided with the is of 16Amp which does not fit the switch board."
5137,5,"Good monitor for daily browsing. Auto eye care technology with 2 hdmi Port. No hdmi cable including but a dvi cable in this package . Sound is very weak. But u have audio output near hdmi Port
I got it 7.2 k in festival day s . screen is good.also have auto detect input."
5138,4,Best
5139,5,Very good monitor and I am using it at least for 12 hours daily for office work for last three months and still working perfectly. Graphics is very good suitable for all graphics work also.
5140,4,"Wonderful products. I purchased at around Rs. 7100. It's decent at that price point.

Pros

- Bezel-less screen

5161,4,"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!"
5162,5,"Monitor is well built and IPS panel is good enough for multimedia consumption and development purposes.

Pros:
1. BI sensor works really great. It adjusts the colour temperatures automatically based on room brightness.
2. Auto turn off feature works just as advertised. It Saves power consumption when it is sitting idle.
3. Quality HDMI cable is given in the box.
4. Out of the box settings are sufficient enough to use it without any extra efforts.

5167,5,Was looking for options in more popular brands and a local retailer suggested that BenQ is worthy one. Multiple input/output options makes it very convenient. Upto the expectation. Eye care technology is of great value.
5168,3,"It's an ok item, not best in class. Speaker is useless you can not listen music even if you are alone in your house, picture quality is not up to the mark. If you want to watch some content on your monitor so it is not for you.it is good for office work only. Aap it is an OK item but it is Good by price point. Make sure Don't Go by seeing Eye Care option it's also useless. Picture quality is really near to bad. But not bad at all."

The colours are good, the Black Levels are adequate and u can adjust it too.
It says 1ms response time but by default it is 4ms. You can turn on the VRB mode to get 1ms but it may strain your eyes.

I would say there is no such noticeable difference in 60hz or 75hz.

For Gaming, You would love playing Story Mode games in this Monitor as the colour output is good. But for Compet..."

If you buy these you will feel style dropping off from these.Its beautiful ;)...Loving it.
PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AUSTRALIAN IMPORT SO NO INDIAN POWER CABLE.........................."
5180,4,"The monitor was worth an investment. The display is nice and the screen area cover is good too. I am yet to discover all the display features but the options of brightness to be set for reading, net surfing, etc is a good one.

it is actually lcd moniter with led backlight, when black. colour comes on screen it looks too darker like almoded display"
5190,4,Nice on price worth! but not good for long view / side view I have purchased it for the purpose of a TV in my room. Sound quality is low less bass and volume over all loved it!
5191,5,The product was great I am loving it and it's working properly and nice packaging nice monitor
5192,4,Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.
5193,3,"I am little bit angry. This is LCD Monitor not HD + LED described by your heading line.

5198,5,"Although the monitor is great, and very vibrant, I would like to suggest the seller to change the product detail as this monitor only support vga and hdmi input and not dvi as shown in pictures, and another thing, the mac resolution is 1344 x 728 and not 1600 x 900 as mentioned on the details page. Other than that, it's a very good monitor with a little wider fov."
5199,4,"A must have for people who work on coding or your office work. You can have the screen tilted in any direction you like. You can get other monitors for cheaper price but make sure you get a stand like this.

The downside the cables which comes along with it are of no use. You won't be able to make it work with you laptop. I have a z book which has almost all the connectors available but the cables which comes along with this monitor doesn't work at all."

Highly adjustable stand.
Bezel less 24"" good quality display
Usb hub with 2 3.0 on side (use it for pendrive and all) and 2 2.0s on back side (connected ny keyboard and mouse to it)

5. Dell Software known as DDM (Dell Display Manager). One can customize Brightness, Split Screen, View mode like comfort view etc. (Download it from Dell website)

Cons: 1. No HDMI cable is shipped along the monitor. 2. No headphone/audio out Jack.

Overall, one will love it.
Thanks Dell and Flipkart."
5202,5,"Really good quality product. But remember, you have to Calibrate it at the beginning, which is pretty easy too! Awesome build quality. Colour, Saturation & Sharpness is just the perfect!

Important Note: If connected over HDMI, change the default 'RGB' mode to 'YCbCr' to achieve an accurate blackness of the screen, resulting in to perfect Saturation."
5203,4,Nice Product. Suitable for work from home. It does not have HDMI Cable in the package. We need to buy it as a separate one. But overall nice monitor for Work From Home with good budget

5219,5,The monitor was pretty awesome after upgrading from a 60hz monitor to a 165hz . I tried csgo and valorant it was a pretty huge difference you can also feel the smoothness and the colour contrast was awesome as it has a IPS panel quite awesome deal it is
5220,5,I don't know much as i used to have a 17 inch and 60 hz monitor but after buying this it feels like i have the smoothest PC in the world (i know there are better monitors and stuff but pretty good for a gamer ) but the speakers is kind of useless its sooo low in volume
5221,5,Excellent monitor! Made my games look so smooth without a graphic card! I am currently using Ryzen 3400G APU and with the freesync enabled it works perfect! And another feature is it's speakers which are usually not available in this segment. They sound great!
5222,5,"Very good monitor. Next day delivery. Its almost bezel less on the sides. Very premium with brushed finish on the back. I can even set 4k resolution at 60fps, however 165fps is for 1080p. Good solid buy @ 10.5k price."
5223,5,"I have upgraded from aoc 60 hz TN monitor to acer nitro 165hz ips monitor which gives a huge difference. Through hdmi am getting 144hz refresh rate , to get full 165 hz use dp cable . Overall fabulous monitor!!"
5224,5,"Updated model of Vg240p.

Pros : better refresh rate(144->165hz)
VRB is helpful to reduce motion blur, good colour reproduction, speakers added, Dp cable added.


Cons : plain moniter stand, you can't adjust the height and you will have problem placing moniter close to you due to V shaped stand that might get in way for Mouse/keyboard



!BEWARE OF THE SCREEN IT IS VERY DELICATE ,SIMPLE TOUGH MIGHT BREAK THE SCREEN A PART.!"
5225,5,Very Much Thankful to Flipkart and the Monitor Provider Also. 1st monitor come with some pixels issue. But after the replacement monitor is too good. Thank your Flipkart for the quick Response. Best monitor at this Price Range. Go For it If any one want to Buy It .

2. Very good contrast level comparing to LG monitor, that I already used in past , LG 24mk600 .

5237,4,If video is Full HD or 2K then this monitor works like a charm otherwise video appears distorted. My HP IPS panel in same price range has better clarity and colour reproduction but only difference is audio out which is available in this monitor.

5241,3,"Big 16 amp of power cord is provided

I would suggest to buy GW2480 instead of this as it comes with speaker and other two which I have mentioned above."
5242,4,Its okay
5243,1,"A monitor which can easily operate on 6a power cord is supplied with 16a power cord, still this change is not mentioned in the description. Support from flipkart team was horrible."
5244,4,Awesome product.
5245,5,Value for money monitor for WFH people. VGA ccable is given in box. Only cons for me was the 16A power adapter for which I had to buy a conversion board
5246,5,GOOD PRODUCT
5247,3,"Price got reduced by 1000 by the time my order was delivered. Is it possible to return the product and order the new one with cheaper price!

The base of the stand delivered to me looks to have a very minor scratch like it was already used. And a screw on the back side of the monitor looked loosened and worn out. I tightened it up to insert the stand. Hope the product is fresh and not the used one. Product is good and this review is for seller."

5266,5,Super display and very satisfying picture quality.
5267,5,"Good, fast delivery.

Good monitor for office work and 1080p gaming. Amd free sync ability helps go 75Hz without vsync. Colors could be better, though. And the dynamic contrast ratio is more pain than pleasure.

Bezels are not as narrow as it seems. The rim is definitely narrow and the glass big, but when on you will notice gaps around the screen on the edges, under glass.

No bundled driver. Default drivers work fine but if you want a bit more functionality use the online driver/controller ..."

5292,4,Very good product
5293,5,Good performance. Does its job well. Got it for 600 rupees less than amazon.
5294,3,"This comes with 15 amps power cord, that means bigger 3 pin plug similar to those used in geysers/submersible. Thus no point of buying it unless you have multiple 25 amps socket boards in rooms."
5295,5,Good product
5296,5,"Perfect, easy to assemble and flexible to adjust both height and tilt of monitor. It have inbuilt speakers too."
5297,5,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:
Like every IP..."
5298,5,"A definite upgrade over the popular 22mp68vq. For a price of 11k, choosing this over that is a no-brainer! 75hz refresh rate supported natively as well over HDMI. 24 inch is perfect size for a 1080p display, so I am glad this isn't smaller or bigger. PERFECT!"
5299,5,"Exactly as i hoped it to be, deeper dark and brighter whites , decent picture quality, less bright though, but nice to watch movies in less illuminated room, don't get bothered about the ips glow (pretty much acceptable ), all in all best budget ips 75 Hz monitor with freesync."
5300,5,"Bought it for WFH. It's an amazing purchase. The colours are good, bezels are thin (only 3 sides). And the joystick is fun to operate. There is a reader mode in the monitor which blocks blue light. Also it's probably not mentioned here, but vertical angle adjustment is possible.
Only thing which took me by surprise is.. The back portion is white coloured which is not obvious from the images shown here. I was fine so kept it."
5301,5,It serves my daily needs as I am not a hardcore gamer and LG has its own software for on screen control. You need to download the latest version from LG's website. HDMI cable is included. And the picture looks superb as the monitor is connected with my Gigabyte Raedon RX570 4 GB GPU. Bezel less design adds spices to the picture when you are watching movies or play games. The software will give you the freedom to choose pre defined picture mode or you can create your own. Depth of Black is ver...
5302,5,"Really best panel good viewing angle loved it LG is best (Gaming, Editing, Etc ) best."
5303,4,"Very Good buy, got it for 10400. Has read mode which is very useful during programming. Only drawback is that it doesn't have usb ports. Only 2 hdmi 1 vga and aux out. If you just need a very good hd 24 inch display and ready to connect to external speakers then go for this."
5304,5,just buy it but it is not 4k u can't play 4k video/movie in it and u Don't get 4k in 24inch u have go below 18inch or from 27inch.not good for front eye user. use it from little far ok... overall best for price.
5305,5,"This IPS-technology monitor meets my needs exactly. It has nice borderless design, awesome viewing angel, Radeon free sync. On-screen control is very easy and useful features."
5306,5,"A real gem with 24"" screen within this budget with 75Hz screen refresh rate. It's buttery smooth in gaming and during normal work as well. It can be recommended to any type of user, without any doubt."
5307,5,"Monitor is good looking and excellent image and video quality, I purchased during big billion day and delivered within 3days, worth for money and recommended for budget purchase."
5308,5,nice monitor comes with vga port & hdmi port good design clean & safe packing

Now if a person is using 60 Hz monitor, they will immediately feel the difference of 75 Hz refresh rate (By the way 75 Hz is only active using HDMI cable whic is again include with packageüëå).

Old TN monitor had decent picture quality but no where near to this IPS monitor.

Design and ergonomics:
Premium design and finish. Looks very classy. It's not the slimmest monitor out there but it's uniformly slim rather than being very bulky at the bottom like HP ultra slim monitors. The stand is strong, very stable and metallic. The stand is a bit heavy since it's metallic but the monitor itself without the stand is very light ~2.5kg. The whole body, including the stand and the front chin, has a matte finish..."

This one ain't that of a gaming monitor from my experience."

5511,5,"The monitor is a perfect combo of performance and price.

The viewing angles are great,the matt finish on the screen is a great plus to save our eyes from long hours of exposure to the screen,also there is seperate audio in and out ports which makes it easy to connect with external speakers via aux .

The only bummer for me was the lack of a headphone jack,which would have made it a perfect buy."
5512,5,"Amazing and Excellent product at this price tag. Except sound quality everything is perfect. Sound is little bit low and you need to use speaker system. Just select mode of screen and there you go. Excellent colors, Thin Bezel makes it very easy and true picture quality.

Delivery was within 2 days!! Simply perfect üëå

It comes with HDMI and VGA cable as well."

Colours are good ,
300 nits brightness makes it brighter , one more monitor I saw was of Acer that was of same specifications only difference was of brightness that was 250 nits brighter .
Both having 75 Hz refresh rate .
That's price of 8500 and this HP costed be 12600.

5620,1,"This is one of the worst product I have purchased on flipkart till date.

When I connected this Monitor with my MacBook Pro Retina, the resolution is too blurred that I am not able to keep my eyes on screen for not even 10 minutes at a stretch.

Even I tried playing normal 1080p HD video just to check whether its the issue with my MacBook. And there also I see this monitor resolution is very dull.

I contacted Flipkart to return this product, but they simply denied saying this is not under r..."

5623,5,I love the quality and the refresh rate of 75 Hertz
5624,5,"After using it for almost 7 months, I feel the monitor is more comfortable to use. I recommend this monitor for those who want to avoid looking at smaller laptop screen."

5636,5,"I recently bought this monitor to go with my new assembled pc (i5 9400F + Nvidia 710 card). I am super impressed. I had to tone down the default brightness a bit. But otherwise, it is fabulous. No dead pixels.. Great color rendering.. I use it to have multiple windows open for coding.. I have not faced any of the issues mentioned in other comments like excess light bleed or dead pixels.
Works in native 1920*1080 resolution with my graphics card.
Makes me very happy to write code on it :-) It..."
5637,5,"First impression:
Work: Its good that the curve is not so deep but is right enough to deep dive into my work.
Text: Appears clear but not perfect while the resolution set to 1080p. This also depends on the PC for micro adjustments of text clarity.
I feel for a monitor of 26"" monitor with a 2.5 feet viewing distance its clear enough to work.
In case its not on our range we can tweak using sharpness control or upscale feature modes.

5644,5,Amazing deal with Flipkart watch the unboxing video on baba dk youtube channel
5645,1,Best monitor ever only problem is it doesn't have built in speaker otherwise I loved it. But after using 2 days it started giving blue n pink screen with blur
5646,5,"I must recommend this model for Developers.
For better result, use HDMI or DP cable instead of VGA"
5647,5,Excellent product
5648,4,Wonderful monitor. Paid 16k for this 27 Inch monitor. Build quality is strong enough. You will have to buy hdmi cable and the monitor plag will not fit in normal socket. You will need 16 amp socket for this.
5649,5,"Best monitor, Just go for it"
5650,5,"I've owned this monitor for about 1 month now & couldn't be any happier.
I've spent a lot of time tinkering with ALL the settings on the monitor along with my pc hardware.

I was able to get 165hz with both gsync enabled/disabled & had no problems at all.
I've never really been into gsync due to latency issues.
Well this monitor does an amazing job at eliminating tears & input lag!
I couldn't any find major reasons why I should disable it besides some minor input lag.
I'll be using it for now..."
5651,4,Very nice product. Quick delivery by Flipkart. Superb gamimg experience with 0.5 ms response time and 165 hz refresh rate. Best suitable for games.
5652,4,Display is amazing!
5653,5,"Packing was great
Lucky i didn't get a defective panel/screen.
No dead pixels
Colors are more than good for a TN panel
Some backlight bleeding
165hz works flawlessly
Can rotate the screen in any direction and can set height According to our preference
Cable management option is wonderful
Speakers are average but shouldnt expect much
It's been a few days since I've got this monitor, will update the review after months of usage.

Overall a great monitor for the price."
5654,5,"great and best at 16.5k price range only a little regret about speakers - ok but not enough for movie or music lovers if u r in working mode it gives u good stereo sound and that's enough for ur long time system sitting duration. about display and color accuracy i say best with curved feeling.. go for it for best gaming, movie and a Big Pc experiance."
5655,5,"I got this one at the offer.... this is really beautiful peace...
Good aesthetics
BIG Screen
3 Years warranty
Value for money.


You can surely go for this .. Awesome .. loving it"
5656,5,"My first PC build and I was not ready to settle down for a small monitor. Acer in this time came as the best recommendation and believe me it was worth. The monitor is huge although the pictures don't justify. I received no faulty product, the delivery was just perfect and I received all sort of display cable. Although the built-in speakers are not that powerful but with the combination of an additional F&D mini soundbar worth 900rs I got my requirements fulfilled and made my dream come true."
5657,5,"This is undeniably the best purchase I have made online. Curved screen gives great viewing experience. 32 inches means you can comfortably watch from a distance of 5 to 6 feet. Colors are set in warm range by default. It came with hdmi, vga, dvi and aux cables, so you need not purchase anything separately.
Only shortcoming is the output of speakers, even 5W bluetooth speakers sound louder.
Overall a great monitor for the price I paid, i.e 13k.

Good packing by Flipkart. Product arrived before..."

5662,1,backlight bleeding issue
5663,5,Really awesome experience with the product unbelievably good.
5664,5,Stand is a bit wobbling and non adjustable ... But the quality of the monitor is really soooo good for this prize. You cannot get 144hz fhd monitor at this prize. So if you are confused dont be ... Just go for it. You wont regret it
5665,4,Everything is good uptill now. I have been using it for 2 months. But its stand is wobbling a lot in the table.
5666,3,there's a dead pixel

5671,5,Very good monitor. Using it for last 2 weeks for office work and it's actually awesome experience. You can also listen audio by connecting ur earphones. Wonderful product.
5672,3,Not the best of hd display. I have an LG ips 21.5 inch led monitor. Hd display of that better than this one. Couple of inches of screen size should not make this difference. May be the price is the reason because this costs less than the 21.5 inch one though the technical specs etc are all same.

The IPS display with fast refresh rate is awesome."

Very easy to aim in FPS gaming with all freesync, extra crosshair and response time 1ms.

Make sure that your pc can produce 144hz otherwise you wont get any 144hz image processing.

For gaming 27inch will be more comfortable, but it will do okay."

Would surely advice anyone to go for it. But you should also be able to live with the fact that isn't adjustable according to your wish. Also if there is any other color variant available then please go with a darker variant. It won't stay study and might wobble a little if there is any movement of the desk it is kept on.

All over itt a good and a valuable product to buy."

One good advantage is that due to nvidia 's dsr super scaling and it being a 1080p monitor i can increase the resolution to 4k and all games support it. At 4k the display even though downsampled to 1080p looks just stunning but my gtx 1060 can not handle 4k. It can on..."

Samsung and LG has TN panels in this price range and HP has come up with IPS display which is far better than any other TN panels.
If you are a hard core gamer then I suggest to go with a TN panel with low G2G response time.

To top it all, large display helps to do office tasks easily. Flipkart delivery and packaging was prompt and top class."

Cons:

5885,5,"The monitor is great but there is no power cable included. I bought one from a local shop. There is also no HDMI cable included. Just the display port cable and a USB cable.

The monitor stand is pretty good. It has height, swivel and tilt adjust."

I think it's good decision.

Pros
Excellent build quality
Super steady stand
Bright colours
Very thin borders
This a latest model from Lenovo

Cons
Flipkart delivery issues..Ecom Express is a worst delivery service
Seller didn't provide power cable
No HDMI cable"
5889,5,"You have lot more options for much cheaper price from brands like TCL, Sanyo, BPL, Vu etc. In this price segment itself you can grab an LG TV or Samsung TV but remember that they are all HD ready and not full HD.
Although I purchased this monitor mostly for work purpose, I have used it mostly for media consumption, entertainment purpose and all because of its mesmerizing and crystal clear 1080p display. This purchase will definitely not disappoint you.

5909,5,"Wow.. It's a beauty..
I did a lot of research before buying this monitor. Whether to go for a widescreen monitor or a normal monitor. Finally decided to choose the widescreen monitor. Got it for Rs 14850 during the diwali sale (including bank offer). I got it, unboxed it and wow!!!!

Pros
* Well built.
* Excellent color reproduction (sRGB over 99%, good for image processing).
* Widescreen is a great advantage for YouTubers, developers, music producers. (I use Adobe Premiere, FL Studio, Au..."
5910,5,"It's a wonderful monitor from LG , the ultra-wide screen is really very very useful, no matter what you do from work to playing games. The colors are vivid, realistic and overall the display is very comfortable to the eyes. And all this at just 15k, is worth every rupee and a must have product."
5911,5,"Too good , i would say !
The display is fab, best for developers, designers and gamers.
Delivery was on time, by Blue Dart.
Amazing Experience!"
5912,4,good
5913,5,"Great for watching movies, games, video editing softwares and even photoshop. You have a lot of area to keep windows, panels and references. And yeah long as* timeline for video editing. Height of the display is not that much. It's roughly 1.25X height of a 15.6 laptop display. But as it says it's ULTRAWIDE! Great when you multitask with multiple windows open."
5914,5,"So this screen is lit for gaming. If you are coming from a 1366 by 768p display, this is gonna be on another level. Movies are so beautiful on this, just because you dont get those annoying letterbox top and bottom.
Just go for it."

Pros:
1. Cheap.. very cheap
2. 31.5 inches so quite big
3. 1080p so you can enjoy FHD (though you are better off with a 4K monitor)
4. Has both VGA and HDMI support (You also get a VGA cable)

Cons:
1. Quality is very cheap
2. The stand is not adjustable and has a very uncomfortable mechanism. It wobbles too much and does not fit well with the monitor. It has a place for four screws (which I suppose would have made it tighter and also co..."
5920,3,"If someone who is gamer, video editor or graphic designer, this monitor for sure is not for you.

It's pixels can be seen very clearly. When play youtube videos it lags , video freezes. In dark room, white patches can be seen from sides of the screen.

So if you have a good budget then plz prefer another monitor.

This is for only those who is fond of using big screen. That's it!!!!"
5921,5,"Perfect monitor for WfH and multitasker .

No strain n eyes even after long usage.

I will advice keep blue light off (screen will become yellowish but need to take care of eyes first)and keep brightness at 20. It won't trouble your eyes"
5922,4,This Monitor I'm useing from last 5 month. Monitor is good for basics like. There is only one HDMI port thats not good because some we need to use sometime in laptop and pc.

Overall good display bt no speakers."

The product is awesome. Very catchy. The best part of it is its price point.
Picture quality is awesome, viewing angles are great. Overall a great piece of electronics.
The bezel is smooth and has got a great finish, Samsung you did a great job.
I recommend this monitor for average gaming, photo processing. Watching movies
in this curved immersive monitor is a great experience."
5929,5,"Best product in affordable price. Very satisfying high definition picture quality and easy to get whole coverage of content due to its curved feature. Has a good degree of freedom. Overall its a great product and great service of flipkart(given date of delivery was 12 days, but it was delivered within 5 days.)"

5931,5,"A new experience. It's a very good monitor. My ratings are:

For power consumption -10/10 (1..."
5932,5,This monitor has an excellent display and the curve really makes it super immersive. HDMI cable is not included so I can recommend purchasing it if you want to run it in Full HD. It's also the cheapest 24 - inch monitor with 1080p display so go for it.
5933,5,"This monitor is just awesome. Amazing picture quality. I can do coding and watch anime's for whole day and night.
It is also good for eyes. No reflections at all. I was tired of my laptop screed because of the reflection in day light but this display does not reflects at all so i can work at day time as well.
Now i can watch anime's or do coding stuff without crying ( OK I cry sometimes but because of the anime's not because of display. Ahh anime's are great)

5936,5,"I've got the product after one day from the delivery date. What can I say about this product man this is Samsung. How can you doubt about Samsung's picture quality. Well let me tell you about the packaging. This huge beast came in a box which is around 3 inch by 4 inch larger. Product was kept in there safely. The product was carefully packed. After opening the product I see that the seller provided a brand new VGA cable for my PC, along with the power adapter and power cord. The picture qual..."
5937,4,"Not ideal for graphic design or any other creative work. because of the curvy panel make straight lines to look also curvy, lines are straight only from a particular distance and angle. Nobody can sit in a certain position for long, when you move a bit from the angle everything changes.
And the monitor stand is too weak, if you touch the monitor it will rock for next few seconds ‚Äì which is super annoying.
Only good for media consumption and basic computing."
5938,5,"Fantastic product & have bought it for 14,499 rs while it was on sale. Simply the best TN panel within 20k range. Blacks are deep, colour looks natural, punchy & sharp. A true 1ms monitor with input lag lesser than 2. This is the reason this monitor is still being sold in huge numbers. Truly a good product from Asus."
5939,5,I LOVES THIS PRODUCT..ITS AMAZING...REALLY TRUE GAMING EXPERIENCE.GREAT JOB ASUS.144HZ AND FEATURE PROOF MONITOR.
5940,4,"Excellent value for money.
Con: Brightness needs to be manually reduced to acceptable levels. Refer ASUS website for guidance.
Secondly the angle/height lock tends to slip as it does not have a positive locking system."

5942,5,Great monitor with terrific colors..
5943,5,"I think I am the first one to write a review for this product. I bought this product on a nice discount and it's absolutely superb. The monitor was easy to assemble and the moment I switched it on, the clarity was magnificent. All the monitors in this category, I believe are of similar rating but I simply love this monitor. Also, the ''eye saver'' option is very cool and very good for the eyes. Thank you, flipkart and samsung."

Purchased it for 17K during a sale and man 144hz is really night and day difference as compared to 60Hz displays, I can't go back and play games on 60Hz displays now after experiencing the beauty of 144hz. It sure has some flaws like every other monitor in the market atm. I switched from an IPS panel and the colour quality of this monitor is almost as good as IPS if not better, If you a lot of FPS like Overwatch, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege o..."
5978,5,Superb service from flipkart as they have managed to deliver the product before the promised delivery date. Ekart staffs were very supportive to help me out on the delivery of the product before time as it was very urgent for me to receive that product on that day only. Besides the monitor is hell of a good one which fulfilled all my requirements.
5979,5,Super gaming monitor and quantum dot technology gives you more vivid colours. And the stand is the best thing about in this monitor. Perfect gaming monitor and also best for watching movies because of it's quantum dot technology. Viewing angle is awesome almost feels like IPS panel. Bought it for 22.2K during big billion day with SBI cards. And Flipkart does not give you service for installation just call a Samsung service number and installation will be done for free.

Clarity-
‚Äî Clarity is better than any other company's monitor in this range. Better than LG MP68
‚Äî However its lower clarity than HP 22es or HP22fi. I have both of those and I think they are a tiny bit better.

Looks-
‚Äî HP 22es is significantly better looking monitor than this one. The looks on this are very plain with a brushed finish that is miles behind from HP 22es
The looks of this monitor are simple corporate type. The stand wobbles a bit.

5988,4,"Worth for spending 9000 Rs. super clarity and style.
its well set for photo editing and video editing.

5990,5,"awesome quality , super easy setup , perfect for desktop/ extended laptop screen"
5991,3,Its color is not good as my 10 year old Benq 24inches VA panel monitor. Benq has more color depth. IPS panel monitor's Black color is also washed out compared to VA panels one. I have another IPS panel monitor from LG. Its color quality also same with this HP model. But overall for the price this monitor is worthy enough to watch film and gaming.
5992,5,"Before ordering I though it would be bulky. But not. It's decent slim(not as slim as 22es). Vivid and crisp display. Got Power cable, Vga cable and HDMI cable within the box. Packing was excellent."

Pros:
1. Almost no rim to the screen. Looks awesome even when switched off. Elegant.

After some research, I narrowed down to the Dell UltraSharp U2414H, the Dell UltraSharp U2412H, and the Asus MX239H. There were not many reviews for the Asus MX239H, so I went with the popular choice of Dell Ultr..."

Pros --

2. Matt finish makes it look even better. You can place this monitor against any light source without much glare.

6000,5,"Got this monitor delivered from flipkart and here are my views after a few days of use.

Firstly, this was a great and required upgrade for me from my old TFT Monitor. While it still works, watching new 1080p movies was just not so great on that. Now with the new HD monitor watching high quality movies & T.V Soaps is just unbelivable.

The on-screen display is far better than most. The four touch-sensitive buttons on the front work reliably, and although they aren't labelled, context-sensitiv..."

6002,5,I use this monitor with MBP and the features are great and it is a perfect match for my MBP. Best I like is the USB 3 hub which is missing in the other models I was looking at. Worth the money.

6047,1,"The one I received was not full HD even in the spec sheet and box say its not full HD, forget actual display quality. It says 720p. Refresh rate again wrongly claimed as 4ms, box says 6ms. Display quality is pathetic, it works for my occasional usage for cctv so not returning. Dont buy this, there are better ones at similar prices and the seller wont be a cheat either."
