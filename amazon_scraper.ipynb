It has a mat finish so it is also a fingerprint magnet.Apart from these two everything else is good about this laptop.But I am going to write about the main issue I had faced that is WARRANTY. After setting up the laptop HP Assitance Center was showing I have only 9 months of warranty left. It is a very common issue nowadays if bought online. But to fix it you need to do the following steps1. Open the Hp Support Assistant2. Click on support resources3. Click -> Chat with an Expert4.  Then your default browser will open and after giving some info like phone number and email id chat will be started. BUT BEFORE STARTING THE CHAT GET THESE FOLLOWING THINGS READY :4.1. Invoice 1 [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order]4.2. P-slip/Warranty 1 [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order]4.3. Printable Order Summary [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order]4.4. Picture of a portion of the laptop where the serial number is printed which should match with the serial number provided in  P-slip/Warranty 1[Step. 4.2.]5. If you have done step 4 just provide the following text with your own details. I purchased [HP Pavilion Gaming - 15-dk0268tx] from Amazon on [YOUR PURCHASE DATE] which is delivered by [DELIVERY DATE]. My laptop Serial Number: [YOUR LAPTOP SERIAL NUMBER] and Product Number:[YOUR LAPTOP PRODUCT NUMBER].  But while checking the warranty on HP Support Assitant it is showing only [YOUR REMAINING WARRANTY] months of warranty left starting from [YOUR INVALID WARRANTY START DATE] and ending on [YOUR INVALID WARRANTY END DATE]. But it should show 1 year of warranty from the date of purchase (i.e. invoice date) from Amazon which is [YOUR PURCHASE DATE], and warranty status should show 1 year left.6. They will send you a mail with case ID while chatting and they will ask you to reply to that mail with all the related documents attached.[specified in step 4]7. And if everything goes well they will send you an SMS with confirmation that the warranty date will be updated and will be reflected within 24 to 48 hours. Luckily in my case, it took 14 hours.Still, Amazon and HP both are good at providing their service but Amazon SELLER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE  WARRANTY ISSUE before selling the product.

Design is very cool and build quality is average made of plastic.4. Battery is same as most of the gaming laptop.5. Nivida 1650ti makes very smooth gameplay with 144hz screen.Cons:1. Touchpad button is not very comfortable to press.2. Display is little bit on down side, but perfect at this price point.3. Volume of Sound is also lower side.Conclusion:There are not major issues in this laptop but you have to do windows update etc. At this price point HP is beating every single laptop out there with the Combination of (Amd 4600H + Nvidia 1650ti + 144hz screen).

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I wanted to buy a laptop and my main purpose was fast processor, occasional photo and video editing, good overall design and longevity. This will look something like minimum 4 core processors with up to 4 GHz, 500 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM, min. 4 GB graphics card. Other preferences were that the laptop should be less than 2 Kg, has decent thermals, good audio and mic for video calls and battery life of at least 4 hours on normal usage and easy to carry design.  My budget was limited, so I definitely couldn't afford i7 10th gen laptops which cost more than a lakh. In my budget of 60k, I had just two options-  Ryzen 5 4600H or Intel i5 9th generations.I read lots of reviews, watched a lot of youtube unboxing videos, and visited nearby stores also to check hands-on. And my conclusions are as follows:Ryzen 5 4600 H is much ahead of Intel i5 10th generation and matches upto intel i7 10th gen in some areas. The reason is 7 nm architecture and 2 additional cores, better thermals and more efficiency in utilizing RAMs. These processors are so popular and in demand that since June, the laptops listed on Amazon and Flipkart started getting out of stock within a few hours of being listed. So, my best bet was definitely Ryzen 5 4600H over any other processor.In August, HP launched Pavilion Gaming laptop with Ryzen 5 4600H laptops with Nvidia GTX 1650 4 GB graphics card on Amazon which was listed at a price of 60,990 but with 1 TB 5200 RPM and 8 GB 2666 MHz RAM. The laptop had many complaints of slow boot speed, but that's because of the 5200 rpm HDD. At Least they should have provided 7200 rpm HDD with such high specs. This meant, we definitely had to invest in a M.2 NVME SSD of 500 GB to utilize the processor speed which would cost me approx. 6-7K. That laptop is currently available at 65k on Amazon.In a couple of weeks, HP launched a slightly upgraded version of the Pavilion Gaming laptop with same specs but with 512 GB NVME SSD, 1650Ti 4 GB graphics card and 144 Hz LCD screen at 70,990 but the price was later increased to Rs 71,999. In a few days another variant was launched at slightly increased price with 1 TB HDD and 256 GB SSD. The HP Omen laptop os similar configuration is also available in similar specs but with 60Hz screen in between 76-81k online.However, Asus Tuf A15 with Ryzen 5 4600h, 144 Hz screen and 512 GB SSD was again back in stock the next day and provided exactly the same specs to the Hp pavilion gaming laptop of 72k but at least `10k cheaper. Another benefit Asus Tuf A15 gave was upgradability of RAm upto 32 GB compared to 16 GB in Pavillion. The laptop was out of stock within a couple of hours. But, what attracted me was the availability of the Ryzen 7 4800H within 76K which is actually a steal. However, I went with HP Pavilion Gaming with Ryzen 5 4600H, 512 GB SSD with 144 HZ screen over Asus Tuf A15.In my next section I am going to explain what made me buy HP Pavilion instead of Asus TUF A15 despite the big price difference.Asus Tuf A15 is undeniably the most value for money at least for gaming enthusiasts, but my purpose here is not just gaming but also using the laptop for work as well as content creation. I am a heavy user and normally use my laptop 7-8 hours a day working. When I went through all reviews available on Amazon as well as many youtube videos made in India and abroad- I came across at least 3 issues in Asus Tuf A15.Build quality:Though Asus claims Tuf A15 has military grade design, the reviews and my own hands on experience in Asus store clearly showed that the plastic quality in and around the keyboard is very cheap and can be pressed easily. There are also problems with the quality of hinges which I think is common with most low and mid range Asus laptops. Same with the lid. There are lots of youtube videos where you can see people complaining about the delicate lid and keyboard base. This issue may be ignored if you look at the price. But...certainly this will affect the user experience and most importantly the joy of using the laptop.Screen:Both Hp and Asus come with 144 Hz FHD IPS LCD displays. None of the displays are great for content creators due to 45% NTSC. One common complaint in both of the laptops is their poor brightness and colour gamut. However, if you do comparison, Asus’s screen quality lags slightly behind in terms of saturation and colour reproduction. Though the difference is not very significant, HP’s screen edges out the Asus by a margin in terms of colour reproduction, while Asus’s brightness is marginally better than HP. This is my personal observation and you can also google about this. I only expect that the laptop companies should provide an option of going with a 60 fps screen with better colour gamut for content creators rather forcing us with 144 Hz screen with poor colour gamut.Thermal and fan noise:Almost all users of Asus Tuf A15 agree that thermals are poorly designed because of which GPU and CPU gets too hot reaching up to 95 degrees as per some reviews. . I am not going too deep into it, as you can yourself google it. The main reason is the placement of the fans away from the processor and the poor ventilation design. Due to the design flaw, Asus has put powerful fans to pull and push air through the small vents. This had again two effects- heating of the body which is of not great quality plastic and load on the cooling fan which has to constantly run at high rpms. The 2nd turn off in Asus Tuf A15 is the fan noise. Almost all reviews of TufA15 complain about the fan noise. However, the high temperatures may not have a significant impact on processor performance and the system will work fine. But upgrading memory later may alter the thermal dynamics and one may need to be very careful while tinkering with this laptop. Though the heating and noise is within acceptable limits, it does cause distraction while working. Also, Tuf A15 being approx 350g heavier alongwith hot air coming out with noisy fans may prevent you from using the notebook on your lap or using it for longer durations. Compared to Asus tuf A15- HP Pavilion thermal are much much better and there is hardly any noise coming out. There is ample ventilation given below and to the back which is powered by two fans which is placed just above the processor. It is perfect for long work, and you can place it on your lap without worrying about the heat and noise.Battery:Asus Tuf A15 comes with 48 WH 3-cell battery while HP comes with 52  WH 3-cell battery. However, the average backup time in both the laptops varies significantly. While Asus claims 6 hours, HP claims 8 hours backup. I have used the HP laptop for 6 hours straight surfing the web and working on MS Word. People who use Asus claim to reach around 5 hours. HP has clearly an advantage over Asus in this segment because of better power management, much of which owes to better thermal management.Sound:The Bang & Olufsen speakers in HP Pavilion are much much ahead of the in-built speakers in Asus Tuf A-15 in terms of clarity and loudness. HP Pavilion also comes with dual microphones which are placed just alongside the camera. On the other hand, Asus provides DTX Ultra 7.1 sound drivers which you can connect to your home theater or headphone. In my opinion, having good quality speakers is much better in a laptop than having a driver to use in an external speaker. In this segment, HP is the clear winner.Design:HP is known for design which caters to working professionals and Asus is known for innovation and caters to youth and gamers. This can be visible in these two models.  HP Pavilion is lightweight just below >2 Kg compared to Asus Tuf A15 which weighs 2.30 Kg. Over that the design of HP is targeted towards content creators and the plastic quality doesn't feel cheap and the laptop itself is quite sturdy. Asus on the other hand feels cheap and the plastic quality is just okay. The keyboard of HP pavilion is white single colour with 2 brightness level and raised keys, while Asus has multi color RGB keyboard with highlighted transparent keys W-ASD keys which gives it a gaming look. The keys in both of these laptops are of good quality but provide different user experiences. Personally, I liked the keyboard layout of hp better for working professionals compared to Asus which is made primarily keeping the gamers in mind. The touchpad in Hp is single body design, while Asus has provided separate right and left buttons. The placement of speakers in honeycomb design just above the keyboard is certainly better than Asus and also adds to the premium look. The V-shaped joint between the keyboard and the screen looks much better than the 2 single hinges of Asus Tuf A 15.My Conclusion:Both Asus Tuf A15 and HP Pavilion Gaming are value for money laptops but designed entirely for two different segments of user. If you are working professional, who wants a feature-rich, reliable, silent, sturdy and have a laptop experience-then go for HP Pavilion which is slightly expensive but that is worth the price. If you are a heavy gamer or tight in budget- then Asus Tuf A15 and prefers specifications over features- then Asus Tuf A15 is the best choice.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

Speakers are above average.11. Keys are very nice to work.12. Hinges are far better now, as it is a long one.13. I suggest to uninstall antivirus (Windows firewall is sufficient) and install chrome for smooth usage(stop that explorer).14. Night vision is good.I brought it for 22k !!! U may get surprised.So,.  5 🌟 rating.My opinion:- go for it, it doesn't disappoint you. I think this combination is good . so, it will definitely hit high from now in the market and I will update after some usage.Edit 1:- after 2 months1. I feel display is not great. As it is not IPS2. BATTERY should have been still better than this.3. Main point is it takes time, initially though , for Right click to work.4. AMD gives updates.Edit 2:- After using it for 8 months now.1.) Just increase RAM for better performance2.) Really better than all Intel i3 processor.3.) Don't use it for advanced gaming.JUST HIT LIKE buttonEdit 3:- After using it exactly 1.5 years.It updates regularly, but it irritates as it takes to update for hours, initially when I start it shows lenovo logo and then going screen completely blank.  It happened to me 2 times for hours. LENOVO PLEASE FIX IT.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

Lasts 3-6 hours depending on use. If you wanna do light programming and browsing you have around 4 hours . Light gaming and browsing/music gives 3.5 hours. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING duh for that buy a gaming laptop/xbox or whatev else that is MEANT for gaming.-Free stuff : YOU DO GET MS 2019 (feb) now since you get feb you wont get those new logos but still all features are same. Mcaffee is free for 365 days too =)-you can do light stuff on it-Features that are available on high end laptops like bendable screen(180degrees) and sleek design , thin bezels ARE there. LOOKS GREAT-AMAZING SPEAKERS-POOR WEBCAMThats it :)if you get intel i3 model around 27k then buy that. If this is at 25k buy amd a9. I think you should go for amd a9 as if this is 20/20 then that is 19/20 (just comparing but ryzen 3 isnt 20/20)however for student needs this is perfect. IF YOU DONT DO PROGRAMING AND JUST NEED FOR browsing and making projects and play internet games buy hp chromebook at 24k which is having touch screen today.EDIT :- BATTERY LIFE BECOMES TERRIBLE AFTER 6 MONTHS.

They will not notify anything after continues follow up.In 2nd case, battery backup is also worse. I tried testing the laptop and it is giving only 2.5 hrs backup in standby. But in specification they mentions 5 hrs. After installing my office application they it is giving 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs. For this answer from Lenovo support is Battery found normal working as per design. It is false specification in description.Please choose wisely. I can return this product based on the incident. They amazon/lenovo again sends this product to the people who purchases again. Amazon removed return policy for this product without knowing the feedback.I recommend don't buy it.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember.

The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos.

Some people may feel low speaker volume (it is actually is), though for me it is Very much satisfactory for office meetings and I can also use headephone or attach sound speaker with 3.5 mm jack or Bluetooth for higher volume.-------Pros:- Very thin and light weight like a Mac air- good battery back up, for my office use, battery lasted about for 7-8 hours with 60% brightness.- Boot time is lightning fast to 2-3 seconds.- preinstalled and activated windows 10 and ms office- it is blazing fast. It is much much faster than my current dell i7 4th gen with 16 GB RAM laptop.- backlit keyboard is cherry on the cake.- UHD / 4k videos run very smoothly. Excellent colours and contrast.Cons:- sound loudness could have been better, though sound quality is awsome.Overall, the laptop is power packed with very latest intel processor and technologies like 3200-3700 mhz ddr4 ram, SSD with 32 GBOptane memory, thunderbolt 3 port, UHD/4k display support etc.I am very satisfied with this (66k) price range.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

Also if you are going for ultrabooks you focus on performance of laptop, so on that criteria laptop works great and speakers are not that much disappointment.-Battery life i got is around 12-13 hours on 80 % brightness.-keyboard is good !!!so all in all its a great buy!!\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

Fingerprint is excellent, quick.4. Keyboard is awesome with backlit so that you can see in thr dark.5. Speed is fantastic.6. Apps like windows, msoffice are Preinstalled.7. Downloading is jus a blink of an eye.8. It comess with latest wifi 6version which makes the usage fast.Negative :1.The power button is placed in an odd position on the top right corner, which can be clicked my mistake frequently.

They suggested me to reach Asus help center and which they suggested me to reach Microsoft help center. After discussing with both of the company people and after explaining all the issues facing to Amazon people, they agreed for replacement. Then I got the new one again and this time it is genuine one and perfect product. Above is my delivery experience.Coming to the laptop, boot time is less than 10 secs. Thanks to the Intel optane memory. Screen quality is good. The only drawback is speakers.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After one month, I wrote this review because I was bored and had nothing more important to do.My laptop's exact name and model number are Asus Vivobook S S14 S433EA-AM501TS. (I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup. I've used the laptop for around 2 weeks and here are my thoughts department wise:Display:The display claims to have a 100% sRGB gamut which is supposed to make the display highly colour accurate, and it does deliver to a pretty good extent in that department. The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  ASUS Vivobook 14 flex is just awesome!!!!! It's the laptop that you should consider it buying if your budget is 55-65k. The price to performance ratio is absolutely matchless in this segment. Let me explain the pro's and con's of this and then talk about my experiencePro's :1)Premium build quality. I have seen zenbook from ASUS and their build quality. They cost you more. And it was surprising to see the same finishing and build quality with this vivobook too. Back-lit keyboard, touch screen, Pen to sketch and the tablet folding hinge quality... Everything is top notch ..... Kudos.2) Awesome display!!!! Great viewing angles and the quality of the screen is too good. Deeper blacks and the contrasts here are worth noting👍 you will definitely enjoy the viewing experience with this...... It brings smile in my face everytime I see this display..... Such a joy to watch3)Coming to performance, NAILED IT!!!! Extremely fast with anything you throw at it. With Intel i5 11th generation and DDR4RX  RAM and PCIe NVMe SSD and the super fast WiFi, everything is buttery smooth....The thunderbolt 4 is a gift to mankind..... You charge with USB - C too(however, it has the traditional proprietary input for charger)4)Sound quality is excellent loud and clear!!! Harman/kardon have tweaked these speakers nicely. Impressed.5) Battery life is around 8hrs with moderate to heavy usage. With heavy usage, it would last from 5 to 6 hrs. Completely acceptable. Its fast charging, so it can charge in no time and lasts long.....Con's :1) Would have preferred front firing speakers but still, extremely satisfied with the sound quality2) 1.5kg is still more weight that normal ultrabook..... So, would have been more happy if it was around 1.2kgs3) Trackpad is moderate size. Would have been better if it was more bigger in sizeSo overall, excellent specs and build design with good battery and screen quality with the versatile tablet nature along with pen. Just GO FOR IT!!!!!!!I never write reviews for anything unless I am really impressed. This is one such product!!!\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.Update 24/10/2020.Now, the laptop seems to be better.After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.Update 07/11/2020.I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.Update 15/11/2020,Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excelall the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM.To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.The thing I feel could be provided better is the display.The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

(I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup. I've used the laptop for around 2 weeks and here are my thoughts department wise:Display:The display claims to have a 100% sRGB gamut which is supposed to make the display highly colour accurate, and it does deliver to a pretty good extent in that department. The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Hello Buyers, Below I am listing my points after purchasing this laptop unit.  I just received this today. If this review seems helpful then pls let me know, I will write another review after few months .This option is for them whose budget is around 40k or so and want better performance .Mine was with 512 GB SSD variant, you can check for HDD version also . Packaging from Amazon is quite good and is same as shown in youtube review videos done by few people.I went through many opion like Asus Vivibook,HP ,Dell etc,First  I started looking for Ryzen 3 options , but after I decided to go for Ryzen 5 , buying laptops usually depends upon what will be your daily work. After searching many option this Lenovo model looks pretty good. if you want to go with Ryzen 3 processor then as per my finding till today on Amazon  looks like HP is offering good laptops.Below Are the pros and cons of this Laptop.Not commenting on Battery power as this is new , but it charged completely around 1.5 hrs or so ,and on first go it looks like it may last for 3 hrs if used continuously.Pros:Ryzen 5 ,very good option theses days and value to money and very competing processor against iCore 10.512 SSD,8 GB ram ,giving faster reboot and multilpe apps,chrome tabs are working fine.To test Grpahics , i just tried downloading games from MS store and they ran fine, don't consider this for gaming,first impression is that it can do for some light games.Windows 10 with MS Home Student versions(Very Important Step,Please register both using your existing Microsoft Account or create one ,it will be helpful if format is needed further in laptop,else you will loose your aleady installed and your licensed Windows 10 even though you have authorized one)Body is of Good plastic material but still give metallic FinishIt can handle coding etc software in this configuration.Cons:As review and commented by others Display can be more better and should have more colourfull . This lacks but still should not be show stopper untill you usually works for edting pics or videos.Speaker sound seems ok but more improvement can be done as they advertise this as Dolby one which is no where near to it.Laptop weight should be more light ,still ok.Keyboard backlit should be given in this budget will be a plus .\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.I’ll update this review after one month of usage.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here\\'s my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it\\'ll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn\\'t lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with \"Office Home & Student 2019\" (didn\\'t checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn\\'t checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won\\'t be using it much so I\\'m fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn\\'t knew this, HP Showroom people don\\'t know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I\\'m using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

Viewing in straight, display looks  good.Viewing angles are very bad. In terms of laptop displays it  is average . (Don't compare with our mobile displays)3).Sound: Very good. I didn't expect this quality. Sound loudness is OK.4)Looks and Feel: I bought 'Dreamy white' which looks good. Comparing with some of modern laptops it is slightly thicker and weighty.5) Keyboard and touchpad: Backlit keyboard\\xa0\\xa0 is good. Keys feels smooth not clickery. Touchpad is glass finish. Works well. There is no right and left buttons. Finger print works flawlessly.6)Ports: Charging my mobile tooks 4 hrs.7)Games: I didn't test.(But I think it can manage all the games well at medium level settings).8)Windows office not there.9)Price: After the covid-19 situations, prices\\xa0 of all the laptops incresed by 8 to 10 thousands. And it's newly released product . Hence the price is high. I bought it for Rs 58000(in Great Indian Sale, with bank offer).Conclusion: Best for coding and programming. Good for heavy multitasking. Students and casual users no need to spend this much amount, they can go with AMD Ryzen 5 3000u processor.\\xa0 There is no high end graphics card so not good for heavy gamers. Display not suits to video editing.\\xa0 Overall it's a decent buy for who wants a high performance , multitasking and RAM upgradable laptop which can also do occasional gaming.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After one month, I wrote this review because I was bored and had nothing more important to do.My laptop's exact name and model number are Asus Vivobook S S14 S433EA-AM501TS. (I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup. I've used the laptop for around 2 weeks and here are my thoughts department wise:Display:The display claims to have a 100% sRGB gamut which is supposed to make the display highly colour accurate, and it does deliver to a pretty good extent in that department. The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Review - #1, On 13-Feb-2021Good laptop for the given configuration and price. I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Okay! Let me get straight into the Teardown review of this laptop as the rest of everything can be found on the internetFirst of all, This is the New Lenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen.2 and not Gen.1. Below are the few upgrades you'll notice right away.1. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS Panel (250 nits max brightness)2. Extra M.2 Slot for up to 1TB of Additional SSD3. Extra RAM Slot for up to 16GB of Additional RAMNow, Coming back to the laptop itself.It comes with Windows 10 Home single language out of the box along with Microsoft Office 2019 Students and Home. You'll need to Activate the Office with a Microsoft account. Upon starting any of the Office Apps you'll be prompted for the registration post which Office 2019 will be activated in your account.The first and foremost thing I'd recommend anyone is to log in with Lenovo Vantage and Register the product with the Product ID as many of them are facing a Product Registration Issue which can be resolved after 24 hours of you registering the product with Lenovo. The warranty of the Laptop will then be counted from the date of your purchase.Coming back to the internals of the Laptop. It is equipped with 256GB of PCIe Nvme SSD (WD SN530 2242) which can be upgraded to 512GB as per Lenovo's Website but I'd highly recommend adding in an extra SSD based upon your needs. Also, I've attached CrystalDiskMark benchmarks of the included SSD.Now to the selling factor of this Laptop. Ryzen 5 4500U. As per the Cinebench R23 results the Processor blows off Intel 11th Gen i7-1165G7 out of waters by achieving a score of 5500 (In my test) which is far more capable of any office or students based task.The Speakers are also from Harman and got to say when it gets pretty loud and punchy.The only con I found so far was the Keyboard not being Backlit for the Indian SKU.However, Everything from the Fingerprint sensor to the Battery Life everything is on par with the mentioned description. In my day-to-day usage, I'm getting a battery life of around 6 to 7 hours with 60 - 70% Brightness and Laptop set on Better Battery Mode.To conclude, I would only say one thing to not think twice about which Ryzen 5 Laptop to buy and buy this one without thinking twice or waiting for the Sale to arrive or the Price to drop. You may never know when it may go out of stock and never come back (lol just kidding). Also, If you've read so far clicking on the Helpful button would be sweet :)P.S The Laptop can be also charged from a USB C PD supported power banks and wall adapter.Review Update Regarding the SSD upgrade. Due to some weird reason WD (Western Digital) nvme SSD are not supported in the laptop I tried with SN550 (500GB and 1TB Both) After researching the entire internet I found no working solution so I had to return back the SSD.Then I decided to go for Crucial P1 SSD which upon installing directly got detected into Disk Management and Device Manager in the very first attempt. So I'd highly recommend to go to Crucial SSD over WD SSD for this particular model.Adding this after the Ryzen 5 Pro (4650U) variant was added.Please Note only RYZEN 5 4500U has IPS Display. RYZEN 5 4650U has TN Panel!!!\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Pros1) Upgradability.Western Digital SSD instead of global Toshiba ones.. really good, but only 236 GB out of which your initial windows setup would eat some 50 GB,Anyways pump in a new one, additional slot present.1 Upgradable ram slot unlike other criminals who solder you with 8gb with a Ryzen 4500u2) Fingerprint is dope goodBattery life is good.Keyboard is omg turu loveeeeTouchpad hmm ok.3) 4500u is brilliant, efficient thermals too.4) light weight considering the well built chassis.5) sound is good as per my needs.Cons1) screen could have been better in colour gamut reproduction, anyways not much complaints, not using for any photo video works.IPS panel, good for coders.Tweak amd brightness settings else it would be locked at 100 nits when on battery.250 nits is fine.2) no backlight on keyboard..i thought it would be same as foreign models... anyways i can type in dark_____________________________________The Indian variant instead of windows 10 pro comes with home single language and office 2019 home and studentGood deal in a few ways.Installing linux was a slight pain...typical secureboot EFI issues, no biggie.This is a good bargain at 46k, if you know your tradeoffs. :)---------------------------------------------------------------------One important thing to note would be the warranty.Old*My laptops warranty started 7 days before the day I opened the box.That was the system setup date, which I found when saw windows folderSo please check your device' warranty stuffs too from lenovo vantage, your mileage might vary*_-----_NewUpdate now warranty starts on the actual date..

Actually I bought it in exchange of my HP i3 old generation but sometimes it feels this is even slow than that old one.After 3 day of use ( i3 10th gen/8GB RAM/1TB hdd):1. Speed is super slow and keeps getting hang for 2-5 mins.2. Anything you do hard disk reaches 100% usage and everything gets stuck.Maybe it's maccafe antivirus trail that comes pre installed that is doing this.3. Sound is ok neither good nor bad.4. Internet - I am connected to 250mbps and achieved download of around 25mbps so this is perfect.5. Boot time 2-3 minutes6. Transfer speed from usb/hdd to laptop is good.7. Transfer speed within HDD from one drive to other is 2-5 Mbps which is ultra low.8. Delivery and exchange was good. Done on specified date.9. Camera is just pathetic - 0.3 MP - If you plan to do video calls for office or school you need to buy external cam. Integrated cam is just pathetic and cannot be used.Suggestions- As of now I feel you should not buy this one. Better go for HP.Edited - Amazon and Lennovo team called and helped with different tools. Seems like the Lennovo site tool is not showing correct data. Adding 1 star for support availability. However, system is still very slow for a 10th gen i3 with 8GB ram. Another point to note is you cannot return/replace that option shows not available.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

Please.Not yet played to game (I don't expect anyone who buy this laptop wants to game on it)Overall if you are searching for a mid range premium performance laptop this will be right one to go.Will update this review after my long-term usage!Update after one month of usage:The battery seems to be holding well.performance is good. Standing good for my workload (Excel, Access, editing.. )The screen is so fragile, be careful while opening (use the middle part of screen) - or expect the screen to be bit flexed at edges.The machine seems to be working well. Will update after couple of months usage.After 9 months of usage, the laptop seems to be going well. The battery backup has also been good getting around 5 hours of my standard usage.

This information is not very clearly mentioned anywhere.I got this laptop for 1.23L, this cost is not possible at offline stores (it was available at 1.32L at official showroom), so kudos to Amazon.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After one month, I wrote this review because I was bored and had nothing more important to do.My laptop's exact name and model number are Asus Vivobook S S14 S433EA-AM501TS. (I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup. I've used the laptop for around 2 weeks and here are my thoughts department wise:Display:The display claims to have a 100% sRGB gamut which is supposed to make the display highly colour accurate, and it does deliver to a pretty good extent in that department. The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I have been using a HP laptop since a year and since I was a linux power user it posed a lot of problems, mainly in the drivers section. This laptop came around just during my search for a new one. To be honest ASUS had outdone themselves on this one and this truly is a beauty to have in your hands.Hardware Section :-The Pros:-1. This is a light laptop, seriously light (don't worry the body is aesthetic and strong enough to take in a few blows)2. It has 2 freaking thunderbolts where most laptops don't even have a single one.3. The touchpad / numpad is primary beauty focus point I'd say (you can control the touchpad / numpad's brightness. Yes, it has a dynamic setting)4.  The keyboard is then again backlit keyboard so there's nothing new in here.5. The bezel's are nice, sleek and seriously three way narrow bezels are good, the very reason ASUS did not go with a 4 way narrow bezel is because ventilation is provided below the screen, hence the screen is protected in the long run from the heat.6. The key travel is equivalent to an average HP or a Dell's laptop so you don't basically have to get adjusted to this new machine's end-to-end keyboard, I had no issues in typing the minute I typed the first word.7. The battery lasts literally a whole day. It really does. ( I am on fedora 32 and on 25% brightness at 90% battery the I get a battery to last about 15 hours and 92% battery on windows with 25% brightness, balanced-mode I usually get a 12 hours backup)The Cons:-1. The touchpad can get in the way of the typing since your wrists may touch it, well it may or may not be with you but to get around it you do get the F6 function key to disable touchpad, so I guess that's a great option.2. You may say that this machine gets heated but it's such a sleek yet compact machine that I'd say it's natural but with active fans and ergonomic lift you get a proper ventilation.3. The speakers could have been on top for better sound but that would have only make it uglier but anyway the speakers are mediocre but sufficient.Software:-I am using dual booted Fedora32 + pre-installed windows systemThe Pros (Linux) :-1. You get a working out the box system in linux. Yes it does contain a intel wifi card which has an active support in since linux kernel 5.3+ versions2. The bluetooth drivers works out of the box well.3. With powertop and tlp and reasonable cutbacks on background process one can get 18-20 hours of juiceout of this machine for sure.4. Keyboard backlight works right out of the box in linux kernel 5.7+ versionsThe Cons (Linux) :-1. Touchpad / Numpad gestures won't work out of the box. Just use libinput-gestures or a wayland version.2. Intel-generic drivers of wifi may or may not provide the best of the speed but upgrade to the latest version just in case.Note: Everything works right out of the box smoothly in Windows and it is a seamless experience over there.Overall this is a great laptop for programming and productivity and with this price it seems like best option. Since it's a just-launched product the overall linux support may take a few months.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Update after 6 weeks------No complaints so far. I haven't experienced any issues and all my comments in the original review below continue to be valid.Battery life is consistently strong at 10 hours workday average with some video streaming. I don't do any heavy work on this machine and keep brightness around 40% so this is probably the best you can get from this battery pack. Recharging is awesome and I love the battery protection features that only charge the battery to 60%/80% to improve its life. Charging is rock solid and it generally charges from 10% - 80% in around 1 hour with the supplied charger.I'm enjoying the screen also. The extra 0.7 inches over a 13.3 laptop doesn't sound much on paper but in practice it makes a significant difference. At Full HD resolution it means I don't have to scale the display size in Windows and everything remains readable at 100% scale. On the 13.3 inch Zenbook I always set the scale factor between 105-107%. I don't have to do that on this 14 inch UX425.Other great things that I've seen since the original review. The microSD card reader is so much faster vs. the one in my old Zenbook UX305. This one gives 70mbps / 50mbps with UHS-3 cards which is awesome.The speakers are louder than I initially thought. In a quiet bedroom I only need to keep them around 60% to be comfortably audible. At 100% they can be loud enough for a moderately noisy environment. Works perfectly for calls and for occasional audio-based work tasks.I disabled the Intel graphic app from starting up on launch and that has fixed the auto-dimming feature which was an annoyance. The idea of that feature is to improve battery life, but even after disabling it the batter stays the same for me. It's probably because I keep brightness between 30-50% anyways. However, by disabling the auto-dimming feature the display remains more comfortable for me.The ports are awesome. Perfectly placed and they suffice for me without any extra dongles or docks.The form factor continue to be awesome. The 1100gm weight means I often use the laptop balancing it in one hand for short tasks and it's great because I can move around. Obviously not for anything over 10 mins, but often that's enough to do short tasks.No complaints and I would recommend it if you find it at the right price.Asus launched the new Zenbook range globally, and it should hit India by early next year. For now, I think this is the best fit for my purpose from a price/performance/feature/reliability standpoint.Original review - Aug 2020-------I have been waiting to upgrade my 2016 Zenbook but in the last 2 years ASUS has been disappointing with their Zenbook line features. This release finally gets the combination of most important things right.Core i7 with 16GB RAM, bright enough screen, matte anti reflective screen, smallet form factor, lighter weight than 2016 version.Most importantly, they finally have universal USB-C fast charging, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and an excellent keyboard+touchpad. I have been using the laptop for 3 weeks and I made the right choice to wait for this 2020 line to be launched.When you spend nearly 1 lac on a laptop you don't want to compromise on little things. And this new Zenbook makes very few trade-offs.1. The screen is nearly perfect - 14-inch screen provides enough real estate for efficiency on the go. The color balance is decent. The matte anti-reflective coating is fairly light so it stops reflections but the picture quality remains fairly high. Brightness is good at 300nits but Asus also have a 400-nit 1W screen which unfortunately wasn't launched in India. 400 nits would be a better option at this price. I don't like 4K screens on my work laptop because they cut the battery life significantly so this is fine. I also don't need a touchscreen on a work laptop.2. The form factor is ideal for travel ultrabook - small, light at 1.13kg and fairly durable. There is some flex in the middle of the frame which feels strange as the 2016 Zenbook felt rock solid with its metal unibody. But overall the laptop feels durable enough and helps with the lighter weight. Metal unibody designs are more solid of course but they are also heavier.3. The battery is superb. After about 2 weeks of use I have consistently seen around 10 hours in Windows battery report. This is with 40-50% brightness, office work and some video playback. The Corei5 version should give better endurance but this is perfect for my use case. The 2016 Zenbook Corei5 was giving around 7-8 hours so this is a good jump for Core i7.3. The charging is fantastic. I can plug any USB-C charger from 5V to 20V and the battery will charge (at proportionate speed). That's an amazing convenience when traveling. I tried a mobile power bank, a mobile charger, an Anker 45W PD charger and they all charge the laptop (at different speeds). The charging brick from Asus is compact but is a 2 piece so there is a rather bulky power cord for India. The 2016 Zenbook was a single piece charger that plugged directly in the wall socket. It's not a huge problem because this charger is going to stay at home and for travel will carry a universal mobile charger. Fast charging is also super useful for traveling.4. The keyboard is top-notch. The main reason I chose the 14-inch version over the 13-inch is because of the more spacious keyboard. Again essential for a work laptop if you don't want strained fingers. There are 3 levels of white backlighting and the touchpad is classic Zenbook - big, wide and feels premium. I don't use the integrated number pad too often but when I do it works well.5. Sound - Good enough to watch a movie or take a call in a quiet room and that's all I need. I use Bluetooth headphones/speakers at other times so the lack of a headphone jack doesn't bother me. Asus does include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, so that's great! The speakers are reasonable for an ultrabook so I am happy with the performance. They are not dismal like you will see on Vivobook X403 for example.6. Fan speed - this may not be a huge deal for most people but I absolutely needed a quiet laptop. I was spoilt by the 2016 version and the 2020 Zenbook doesn't disappoint. The fan is mostly quiet for 80% of the workday and spins up only when you are doing any demanding installs, editing etc. I tried a Yoga 640 and damn that thing was noisy as hell!7. Webcam - fine for doing work calls but is pretty average quality. At least it's in the right spot and the mics are high quality.8. Color - I would have preferred the silver color but Asus only offers this Pine Grey color in the 14-inch version. I wasn't willing to make that trade-off because the keyboard is slightly more cramped on the 13-incher. It's a premium looking color but silver does look more premium on an ultrabook.That's all! I'm very happy with my upgrade after 3 weeks of use. Asus also offers an 1 year extended warranty (total 2 years) for $20 so that's useful.I tried a Lenovo Yoga in June and was sorely disappointed. The build quality was average, the fan was damn noisy, battery life was unpredictable, the ports were a disaster (no thunderbolt, no charging, no HDMI) and I received a faulty screen from Lenovo.com.Asus Zenbooks have MUCH higher quality specially for professional use so I am never buying or recommending LENOVO if you are spending more than 60K on a laptop.I was finally happy to let my old Zenbook go for this new model! It's almost perfect.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I use it like a phone. Charge it at night and use it for the entire day! Charges very quickly in under an hour.Performance wise there's obviously no complaints. Its more than enough for most of the people doing serious work. Its incredibly fast. Face unlock works well. Screen is absolutely amazing. Its incredibly lightweight. Speakers are the loudest and clearest that I have ever heard on a laptop.Webcam quality is surprisingly good considering this is a laptop! Its comparable to macbooks.You get manual control of fan (kind of). Laptop can get warm if you are working and fast charging at the same time but you can set fan performance to max and it really helps with the cooling.I don't think any other product is available at this price with these specific features in India.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I received this laptop on 21st April 2021 and i am writing this review after a week's usage.I will break this down into 3 parts which are:1) Specifications2) Real World Performance!3) For whom is it?=>Specifications: How it looks on paper?AMD Ryzen5 5500U built on 7nm technology is a beast and can run through anything you throw at it.It has 6 cores and 12 threads and they are decently clocked. GPU present is AMD Radeon integrated graphics.It comes with 8GB (Micron Technology 3200MHz) SODIMM RAM and out of that 512MB is allocated to VRAM. You can increase the RAM up to 16GB in future with both RAM’s working in dual channel mode.It has PCI Express 4.0 and 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD.For other hardware info: https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c07119618Now if you look at these specs it is definitely a steal deal. No other laptop company is giving you these specs at this cost in India. [₹50,990]=>Real World Use: What things matter in day to day usage?1) Boot time: Try to spell the laptop name along with the model number and it will be up and running. For me it was always less than 20 seconds.2) Battery Life: Normal usage – 6 hours, Intensive usage – 3 hours (These generally vary on what you have installed on your laptop and background processes)3) Multitasking: It can handle your tasks easily and most of the times it will be a cruising experience.4) Display: Here it depends on an individual’s priority. It has a BrightView (glossy) display with 250 nits brightness which is decent for indoor use but it will struggle under sunlight. So, you can either use an anti-glare screen guard for your purpose or make a compromise because of the price.5) Gaming: It can handle casual gaming very well. I played FIFA 19 for a while at low settings and never once it suffered a frame loss. Will update it with more games and cofigurations.6) Portability: It weighs around 1.4 kilograms and is easy to carry around.7) Build Quality: I would say since its lightweight+14inch so a little compromise on build quality should not be a concern. It looks like it’s made of hard plastic but maybe here and there HP might have used some aluminium (or any other alloy). Sometimes when you lift the laptop with a single hand it produces a faint creaking sound. Feels like it’s due to hard plastic but can’t ask more at this price point.8) Ease of Use: It comes with Microsoft office Home and Student 2019, HP Support Assistant, HP PC Hardware Diagnostics & Alexa for romance(lol). So, this gives you a very good platform to work on without any hiccups and still if it’s there (Same old Linux vs Windows thing) then you have enough tools to deal with it.9) HP Hinge: No one talks about it so I brought this up. Most of the HP laptops faced this issue 3-4 years back but now I think its alright. I regularly use HP Zbook as my office laptop and I think this laptop uses the same type of hinge (quality difference is definitely there but Zbook is expensive too). Hinge is not too tight but Ok’ish tight.10) Speakers: They are not adequately loud but produce clear sound with a decent base. If you are using it casually to watch movies/videos in a not so loud room then it will be fine. Dedicated Bluetooth speakers are definitely going to outperform the budget segment laptop speakers. Personal suggestion is to buy one if you are willing to use this laptop to watch movies/videos in a group.11) Heating: Whatever work I have done in last 7 days I did not face any overheating issues (AMD processors are doing a good job here). Fan is silent most of the times. Only when you are running intensive tasks you can hear them gushing air out of the laptop’s fan vent.12) Keyboard: It has a laptop sized backlit chiclet keyboard with two levels of brightness control for the light. Again, I would say it depends on one’s preference and budget.13) Connectivity: It has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2. For day to day use its Ok but not seamless. I faced some speed drop while being connected to both. When I disconnected the Bluetooth, it was back to normal. I still need to confirm it with other users.14) Zoom/Teams/Skype calls: Haven’t tested the video on live calls which very much depends on how good your internet connectivity is but it has a good camera setup. It is missing physical camera shutter but that’s fine with me.15) Trackpad is not that great but it gets the work done. It would have been better if it had two click buttons. It supports multi touch and gestures.16) After Sales Service: HP has one of the best after sales service so it has to be mentioned. It’s always a plus point.Overall, it is a great laptop and is performing better than what I expected. I tried to keep all relevant points and these points may be updated in future after a long-term use. Do let me know if I missed anything.P.S.: No unboxing video was made by me 😜Just a neutral review with no promotions for either party.=>Is this laptop for you?This is a very subjective question and its answer depends on how you are going to use the laptop.In short here are my views:1) College Students: Considering the fact they need to run various simulation/modelling software along with an added benefit of portability it’s a good option for them. This laptop would be able to handle all of that.2) Business Professionals: Its portability will attract you but if you are looking for durability too, I would suggest you to wait a little and see if there are alternatives. Its not a laptop like ThinkPad which can also be used to play cricket.3) Content Creators: Your first choice would be Apple’s M1 powered devices but if you are on a budget then there is no other laptop near 50K who can compete with them on paper. It has 6 cores and 7nm tech whereas M1 has 8 cores and 5nm tech but the price difference is huge. I know it’s a wrong comparison but still it shows the power of this processor. I would encourage you to get one more 8GB RAM stick at the time of purchase only.4) SDE’s/ML Engineers/Data Scientists:  It’s a good laptop for you too. It has expandable RAM capacity and a good processor. It would be able to handle data manipulation, cleaning, etc. well and can run popular software with ease. For those doing intensive tasks like deep learning where high end GPUs are suited, they should definitely give this a rethink. But for that too we have alternatives by using cloud-based processing/computing power. Beginners can manage with 8GB RAM but later on you would need to increase it to 16GB.5) Others: If you don’t need much computation power then go for cheaper laptops, they would also be able to manage your day to day tasks. HP 14s fq1029au is an excellent choice for you.So ending this with just one conclusion….you will not get a better laptop under 51K at this time.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

Decent peak brightness. Excellent viewing angles.3. Decent webcam. Better than expected.4. No heating issues. At full power option, kept only warm.5. Good battery. I guess on normal workload (word, excel, youtube, browsing), you can expect around 7 hours easily.6. Good feedback on the keyboard. Good travel distance.7. Has backlit keyboard.8. Speedy ssd drive and powerful processor.9. MS office 2019 bundled for free.10. Trackpad does the job. Has multigesture support.Cons:1. Looks and colour (subjective). Doesn't feel premium and silver isn't really a good choice.2. Heavier than i expected. Not sleek.Haven't stress tested the laptop yet.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  This is very similar to the lenovo S145 series of laptops in terms of looks and hardware. The only catch at this price is that there is no Microsoft Office in it, which is a bummer for a laptop that costs this much. I5 10th gen processor works fine and two visible changes the laptop has over the s145 series are a privacy shutter for the webcam and the change in the power button placement ( as the keyboard adds a stop button to the media buttons). Also the mouse feels more Mac like.Maybe possible that this laptop might have some hardware changes under the hood, will need to see that in a bit more detail.Overall 4/5 because of no Microsoft office, but if that's not a deal breaker, then this is an ok laptop to buy.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

So while purchasing be alert with such mischief.We purchase these products as Amazon is taking responsibility of product & there specifications as mentioned in the advertisement. And when suppliers delete some of it's accessories mentioning not included in components then this will be very dangerous in near future, they may specify some thing in advertisement and may include different in the list. So whether the customer should see the specifications, or should be worried whether it is included or not in the list.

It has a very good display2. Battery backup is also good3. It has a 4GB RAM & 1TB ROM, so of course it is well sufficient for your needs. You may increase the RAM too.4. Gaming's too going on good.It has NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, which I will rate 8/10% good for gaming. I downloaded NFS in PPSSPP & it's running in 30/30 fps. So you can make it out that's it's better for gaming too.5. It has AMD RYZEN 3 3200U processor that performs tasks at a very fast rate.6. Audio Quality is also nice.The only cons I found are:-1. Camera quality not so good, but it's not too very bad too.2. It has no DVD Writer, or else it have been a perfect laptop. Bcoz I had a no. of CDs at home.But perhaps this laptop might be the one out of many you want to choose.

Touch screen is very good.2. Very fast boots up and functional as fast.3. Keyboard is very nice with backlight4. All needed interfaces are available5. Battery life is good enough,  I mean around 5 to 6 hours of normal use. Dont expect like 10 to 12 hours with 3 cell configuration which is not seen anywhere.7. Screen brightness is good enough.  It's not very high as compared to other laptops,  but very good enough to use in indoors. I think there might be reason not to have too much brightness to reduce blue light impacts on eyes specially when children's are using.8. Build quality is very good, as it is aluminum metal used. It looks very stunning and premium grade.9. Camera is good enough for your regular video calls. I would say don't compare with extreme high grade laptops camera.The only things I say, ASUS should have more colour options  in this grade. At least  black or Grey shades looks more premium specially when aluminum metal is used. But not a bottleneck.Over all, I am happy to use this laptop. ASUS has really improved in teams of performance and build quality. Recommended for college going or for personal or office use. I would say its not for a business class since zenbook is more suitable for that use being smaller and lighter in weight with more Battery.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

The HDD makes it so slow that it takes upto 2 minutes to get into windows. If you are not the patient type - install an SSD or look for another machine.I upgraded mine to SSD on the first day as I do not have the patience for HDD anymore. And as you can see in the video, it gets into windows within 30 seconds (maybe even less).The new pentium processor has proven to be quite good and does not heat up much as well as gives me decent battery life. With regular usage I easily go through 4 hours of work before I need to plug in the charger.Now for the possible upgrades... As you already saw, it is possible to upgrade to SSD (I used Crucial, and very happy with it). Ram is also upgradable. In stock it comes with one chip, but when you pop the \"hood\" you can just insert another one or upgrade both to a higher capacity/speed. I am using stock ram at the moment as I have not come to a need for more ram yet.DVD rom bay - this one is deceiving.As you can see on the photos it looks like there is a dvd rom in the laptop, but no, it\\'s just a dummy cover. When you look under the \"hood\", you will find there is space for optical drive but it is not there. I guess they are cutting costs as not everyone nowadays wants or needs an optical drive. But I have great news for upgrade junkies!You can get more storage super easy and cheap! Just buy an optical drive cradle for your HDD or SSD and pop it in - it is standard size and will definitely fit. You can even use the existing dummy cover on the cradle so that externally it will look exactly the same like stock laptop. What do you think? Not many laptops will give you dual drive option for this price!Now let me tell yous some cons before you get too excited.The weight - it is rather heavy. Almost 2kg and with additional drive it might as well be 2 kilos...Screen quality - if you plan to do graphic design (why would you do that on a budget laptop?), Then you will notice colours are not as real as they should be. Maybe with some calibration and software you can fix that, but it is not my game, so I leave it.If size matters - think twice. It is rather big (not a good thing for a laptop). I had hard time finding a slim fitting bag for it as the laptop has a big \"butt\" (the battery side is way thicker than I am used to).Who uses TWO audio jacks? What is this, the 2010? The laptop has headphone jack and a separate microphone jack, why? Everyone uses TRRS instead of TRS, someone, please tell the guys at ACER this!That\\'s all for the cons... After all, I would recommend this budget laptop for regular day to day use, nothing heavy. And if you can - upgrade to SSD, you will thank me later!Hope you find this review useful and helpful, I use this laptop daily for the past few months already.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  This is the best price I could find for an i5, 10th Gen, Windows Laptop and, Acer is a reputed PC maker.  I needed good graphics capabilities for photo and video. These were my reasons to buy this laptop. Acer is a Taiwanese company but the laptop is made in China. (In fact Lenovo, i think is now fully a Chinese company). There are other options from MI. But there is a wait time. And, generally MI is identified as a strong Chinese brand. So, I did not want to carry a brand that is identified as a Chinese brand.What I really like about this Laptop?:You can feel the i5/8GB performance. It does not make much noise. Almost quiet. The laptop is lite to carry. 15.6 display is big and picture resolution and quality are good. Networking is adequate. It  has a RJ45 port. USB ports are a bit tight. Web cam is good. Audio quality is adequate. There is a HDMI port. It comes with Window 10 Home. The real highlight is the touch pad; almost as good a smartphone screen without the display. Keyboard is good. Easy on hand. It has separate number keypad. I have not tried the Bluetooth yet.It does not come with lot of pre-loaded software which, I like. It has Norton antivirus - trail license. Set the laptop up with Windows Family option so that multiple members can use  it with their own preferences etc saved. I think they let you create up to 6 users.I wish they had the following:I wish they give SSD instead of the HDD for even better performance. No SD Card, No VGA, No CD ROM. No Type  SC connection. The Microsoft Office license is not included. You get a free trail for some time then you have to pay for renewal. Or, if you already have an Office 365 a/c, you can use it, i think. I think a C type connector and SD card connection is required for everything these days.  Given the presence of LAN Port, they should have included VGA also. So that you can use it in a conference room setting where you are required to plug in LAN and VGA projector. (Trust me, most office projectors are old and still use VGA). Now a days most people are  buying laptops for Kids online classes. So, Headphones with mic would be a great value add. So, is a good Mouse. ( They can bundle all these for a nominal price increase)I really need these things to make good use of this laptop.1) BATTERY, BATTERY, BATTERY. It seems to drain out quickly even when I do normal web browsing.2) Fully licensed version of Microsoft Office.My overall recommendation: Overall, I feel it is good value for money. Feels nice. My kids are liking it too. This is the laptop if you need desktop power/graphics with some mobility.  If you need more mobility, the battery is not good. This will not work for you. If you are buying this for Kids online classes, i suggest that you get an i3, 10th Gen with 14 inch screen, SSD and MS office. That can come at a much cheaper price. You can find several freewares at The Microsoft store in Windows 10. I installed Adobe express etc. I am thinking of installing Libre office (there is a charge for it on Microsoft story. I think I will download from a mirror site and do it myself)Hope you find this  review useful. All the best.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

This was the main reason for me returning the product.2) The trackpad would stop working for a few seconds. This happened multiple times.3) The loudspeaker volume was extremely low.Apart from this, some other pointers to someone thinking about buying;1) As this laptop has an HDD, it is very slow to boot up, and opening applications can feel like a chore.2) Battery life was around 4 - 4.5 hours.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After one month, I wrote this review because I was bored and had nothing more important to do.My laptop's exact name and model number are Asus Vivobook S S14 S433EA-AM501TS. (I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup. I've used the laptop for around 2 weeks and here are my thoughts department wise:Display:The display claims to have a 100% sRGB gamut which is supposed to make the display highly colour accurate, and it does deliver to a pretty good extent in that department. The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Review - #1, On 13-Feb-2021Good laptop for the given configuration and price. I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  One word awesome product at this price point. Those who are thinking of buying best gaming laptop at the budget range of 60k to 70k, then this is undisputedly best among others (except Asus TUF A15 laptop subject to availability, going by the specs). Will write brief review about the this product - Pros and Cons.Lets talk about the highlighted key features - 144 hz refresh rate, Ryzen 5 - 4600H, Nvedia GTX 1650, 256 GB SSD along with 1 TB HDD - what else do you need at the price of Rs. 68kPros -Processor - AMD Ryzen 5 4600H, this is the best processor among this price range, even at the higher budget laptops, this processor is getting used. Have gone through many reviews of processor where benchmark of this processor is even better Intel Core i7 - 9th Gen and better than the Core-i5 10th Gen. If you will compare by the value for money then this processor is undoubtedly better then Core i5 and Core i7. Display - Full HD - IPS display with 144 hz refresh rate, its a gamer's delight. You wont get any better deal than this. Only laptop of Asus is providing high refresh rate at this price range, but availability is the big issue (I have waited almost 1 month still its unavailable). I think this is the differentiating factor among all other bunch of gaming laptops. Although colour contrast of this laptop is not so punchy, but no regrets, you won't be able to differentiate untill you are pro video editors or animator. For gaming its best; easily you will get 60 FPS to 80 FPS frame rates in games.Graphic Card - Nvidia GTX 1650 - Just name is enough to boast about the graphics. You will be able to play all modern games at high or very high settings. There is only difference of 7 to 10% in performance if you will compare with 1650ti, so as per my view giving up 7 to 8 k of your hard earn money for 1650ti is not advisable.Storage - 256 GB SSD along with 1 TB HDD. Its more than enough storage. Most importantly it comes with 256 GB SSD which is like icing on the cake if you will analyse it with this price point. Those who are not aware about the SSD, please understand SSD storage device speed is 17 times faster than the normal HDD drive. Normal boot time of this laptop is 10 to 12 secs. thanks to SSD.Others - Sound is good, battery back-up not yet tested but i think its better than the ASUS laptops (based on the various articles), Bluetooth ver 5, etc.Cons -Ports - Limited ports, only 2 usb ports, should have been more usb ports;Expendable Ram -is only till 16 gb, 32 GB upgradable memory would have been better, but 16 GB is more than enough atleast for next 3 yrs.Overall my feedback is that its advisable to everyone who wants to buy good gaming laptop at this price range and lost the patience to wait further for ASUS laptops to be in stock. Also, as per my view this laptop is better value for money as compare to other HP laptops like 15-ec1048AX, 15-ec1051AX.I will be doing full unboxing and detailed review at youtube in some time. I will update my review post that and also share the link of my review soon.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I would say that this laptop is quite underrated since Asus tuf has been out of stock for the past two months and the retail price for the base varient has gone up to 75k which is also out of stock and Hp omen15 has a 60hz display we don't have a ryzen 4600h model with a 144hz screen except this and I'm so glad I decided to get this one.The display is amazing like I didn't have any screen bleeding and the 144hz screen is so smooth compared to the 20ms asus tuf where this one is just 8ms (which is not the best but for the price this is the best)Performance is amazing like Ryzen 5 hexa core is a beastThe build is plastic but it's pretty solid and with GTX 1650 you can push 60fps in most popular First person shooter titlesAbout battery life will update you in the future but the charging speed is quite goodSound quality is quite good toBut never expected the display to be this good I was expecting a unsaturated and low contrast screen but it's pretty amazing way better than Tuf A15\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Based on budget HP pavilion is the second-best laptop just after Asus Tuff A15 just because Asus costs less and provides a bit more.Pros:1)Ryzen 5 4650H2)GTX 16503)144Hz panel4)Keys feel nice while typing5) Ok laptop not to heavy6) 52.5 wh battery which is better than Asus Tuff A157) ventilation is ok unlike Asus Tuff A15 where they almost closed the back panelCons:1)The laptop heats up in the lower right-hand portion specifically I don't know why but it doesn't create performance throttles.2) No keys for turning off and on the display which I had in my old laptop3)only 2 USB port and a USB C port that I never use4) Most of the ports are on the right side which is kind of stupid. After all, this is a gaming laptop. Doesn't the left side make more sense?5)HP Omen command center doesn't have silent/performance etc modes. Just shows the stats you can already see in task manager and also shows temperature.6) The backlit keyboard is a single color which is white. anything else other than white would have been better.Overall, it's a good laptop but I had a bit more expectations.

SellerIts model name as per lenovo website is ideapad 5 14ARE05Various features are not mentioned in product description page and I was doubtful when I ordered whether it will have certain features like fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, etc.Turns out it does have fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, MS OFFICE(home and student) lifetime validity.Comes with a feature where laptop automatically boots up when the lid is openedBoot up time is less than 13 secondsKeyboard panel area( palm rest area) of laptop has got a matte finish, does not feel slippery, feels good to hold.Getting Battery Backup of more than 6 hours, just doing regular tasks, no gaming. ( it has different modes such as Intelligent cooling, extreme performance, battery saving mode, I have kept it on intelligent cooling mode, you might get more backup if you are using battery saving mode)My device came with Premium Care Warranty Pack (i.e. It has a base warranty as well as accidental damage protection for 1 year)Now there are  some negatives:You cannot completely bend the display to 180 degrees ( like few others Lenovo laptops)Audio Quality is Average(no bass)Camera is below average(its actually worse than you expect it to be)You may feel the base of the laptop warm although CPU temperature didn't cross 50 degrees Celsius mark. But still there is a bit of warmth at the base when you are using on your lap.Overall a very good purchase, you can go for it if you are looking for a 14-inch laptop in the 60000 price bracket.(excuse me for any typos)EDIT : RAM is NOT upgradable (Laptop was listed recently on lenovo india website and RAM is onboard, contacted the support number to confirm and the representative has confirmed that there is NO second slot for RAM)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

It's a nice laptop with a hell of a processor, good display, fast read/write speeds, fast boot up, decent battery life, 65W fast charging, fast & accurate fingerprint sensor, backlit keyboard with 2 settings, lightweight, good for programming and stuff but it has its cons such as the Soldered RAM which is a huge bottleneck and it can be a deal breaker for some people. In the product specifications, it says that the Type C port supports Power Delivery, but it doesn't support that in reality. I tried to play GTA V but I could only play it on default settings @ 800*600 resolution and it worked very well as expected, although I couldn't increase the resolution to even 1280*720 due to the limited video memory. Although the speakers are front firing, it's not that loud, better to invest in some external speakers. Webcam, as expected is average/ below average.Update:Within 6 months of purchase, the touchpad started to freeze randomly which I thought was a bug, but in reality, it wasn't. Also, after 3 more months i.e., within 9 months of purchase, the display frame started to come out by itself and broke the hinge. Since, I got the Premium Care Support with ADP (Accidental Damage Protection) free at the time of purchase, I was able to get those parts replaced. I don't have very high hopes that it will last for 5-6 years. So, if you use your laptop for just 1-2 years, then go for it, otherwise don't.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I have been using a HP laptop since a year and since I was a linux power user it posed a lot of problems, mainly in the drivers section. This laptop came around just during my search for a new one. To be honest ASUS had outdone themselves on this one and this truly is a beauty to have in your hands.Hardware Section :-The Pros:-1. This is a light laptop, seriously light (don't worry the body is aesthetic and strong enough to take in a few blows)2. It has 2 freaking thunderbolts where most laptops don't even have a single one.3. The touchpad / numpad is primary beauty focus point I'd say (you can control the touchpad / numpad's brightness. Yes, it has a dynamic setting)4.  The keyboard is then again backlit keyboard so there's nothing new in here.5. The bezel's are nice, sleek and seriously three way narrow bezels are good, the very reason ASUS did not go with a 4 way narrow bezel is because ventilation is provided below the screen, hence the screen is protected in the long run from the heat.6. The key travel is equivalent to an average HP or a Dell's laptop so you don't basically have to get adjusted to this new machine's end-to-end keyboard, I had no issues in typing the minute I typed the first word.7. The battery lasts literally a whole day. It really does. ( I am on fedora 32 and on 25% brightness at 90% battery the I get a battery to last about 15 hours and 92% battery on windows with 25% brightness, balanced-mode I usually get a 12 hours backup)The Cons:-1. The touchpad can get in the way of the typing since your wrists may touch it, well it may or may not be with you but to get around it you do get the F6 function key to disable touchpad, so I guess that's a great option.2. You may say that this machine gets heated but it's such a sleek yet compact machine that I'd say it's natural but with active fans and ergonomic lift you get a proper ventilation.3. The speakers could have been on top for better sound but that would have only make it uglier but anyway the speakers are mediocre but sufficient.Software:-I am using dual booted Fedora32 + pre-installed windows systemThe Pros (Linux) :-1. You get a working out the box system in linux. Yes it does contain a intel wifi card which has an active support in since linux kernel 5.3+ versions2. The bluetooth drivers works out of the box well.3. With powertop and tlp and reasonable cutbacks on background process one can get 18-20 hours of juiceout of this machine for sure.4. Keyboard backlight works right out of the box in linux kernel 5.7+ versionsThe Cons (Linux) :-1. Touchpad / Numpad gestures won't work out of the box. Just use libinput-gestures or a wayland version.2. Intel-generic drivers of wifi may or may not provide the best of the speed but upgrade to the latest version just in case.Note: Everything works right out of the box smoothly in Windows and it is a seamless experience over there.Overall this is a great laptop for programming and productivity and with this price it seems like best option. Since it's a just-launched product the overall linux support may take a few months.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Update after 6 weeks------No complaints so far. I haven't experienced any issues and all my comments in the original review below continue to be valid.Battery life is consistently strong at 10 hours workday average with some video streaming. I don't do any heavy work on this machine and keep brightness around 40% so this is probably the best you can get from this battery pack. Recharging is awesome and I love the battery protection features that only charge the battery to 60%/80% to improve its life. Charging is rock solid and it generally charges from 10% - 80% in around 1 hour with the supplied charger.I'm enjoying the screen also. The extra 0.7 inches over a 13.3 laptop doesn't sound much on paper but in practice it makes a significant difference. At Full HD resolution it means I don't have to scale the display size in Windows and everything remains readable at 100% scale. On the 13.3 inch Zenbook I always set the scale factor between 105-107%. I don't have to do that on this 14 inch UX425.Other great things that I've seen since the original review. The microSD card reader is so much faster vs. the one in my old Zenbook UX305. This one gives 70mbps / 50mbps with UHS-3 cards which is awesome.The speakers are louder than I initially thought. In a quiet bedroom I only need to keep them around 60% to be comfortably audible. At 100% they can be loud enough for a moderately noisy environment. Works perfectly for calls and for occasional audio-based work tasks.I disabled the Intel graphic app from starting up on launch and that has fixed the auto-dimming feature which was an annoyance. The idea of that feature is to improve battery life, but even after disabling it the batter stays the same for me. It's probably because I keep brightness between 30-50% anyways. However, by disabling the auto-dimming feature the display remains more comfortable for me.The ports are awesome. Perfectly placed and they suffice for me without any extra dongles or docks.The form factor continue to be awesome. The 1100gm weight means I often use the laptop balancing it in one hand for short tasks and it's great because I can move around. Obviously not for anything over 10 mins, but often that's enough to do short tasks.No complaints and I would recommend it if you find it at the right price.Asus launched the new Zenbook range globally, and it should hit India by early next year. For now, I think this is the best fit for my purpose from a price/performance/feature/reliability standpoint.Original review - Aug 2020-------I have been waiting to upgrade my 2016 Zenbook but in the last 2 years ASUS has been disappointing with their Zenbook line features. This release finally gets the combination of most important things right.Core i7 with 16GB RAM, bright enough screen, matte anti reflective screen, smallet form factor, lighter weight than 2016 version.Most importantly, they finally have universal USB-C fast charging, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and an excellent keyboard+touchpad. I have been using the laptop for 3 weeks and I made the right choice to wait for this 2020 line to be launched.When you spend nearly 1 lac on a laptop you don't want to compromise on little things. And this new Zenbook makes very few trade-offs.1. The screen is nearly perfect - 14-inch screen provides enough real estate for efficiency on the go. The color balance is decent. The matte anti-reflective coating is fairly light so it stops reflections but the picture quality remains fairly high. Brightness is good at 300nits but Asus also have a 400-nit 1W screen which unfortunately wasn't launched in India. 400 nits would be a better option at this price. I don't like 4K screens on my work laptop because they cut the battery life significantly so this is fine. I also don't need a touchscreen on a work laptop.2. The form factor is ideal for travel ultrabook - small, light at 1.13kg and fairly durable. There is some flex in the middle of the frame which feels strange as the 2016 Zenbook felt rock solid with its metal unibody. But overall the laptop feels durable enough and helps with the lighter weight. Metal unibody designs are more solid of course but they are also heavier.3. The battery is superb. After about 2 weeks of use I have consistently seen around 10 hours in Windows battery report. This is with 40-50% brightness, office work and some video playback. The Corei5 version should give better endurance but this is perfect for my use case. The 2016 Zenbook Corei5 was giving around 7-8 hours so this is a good jump for Core i7.3. The charging is fantastic. I can plug any USB-C charger from 5V to 20V and the battery will charge (at proportionate speed). That's an amazing convenience when traveling. I tried a mobile power bank, a mobile charger, an Anker 45W PD charger and they all charge the laptop (at different speeds). The charging brick from Asus is compact but is a 2 piece so there is a rather bulky power cord for India. The 2016 Zenbook was a single piece charger that plugged directly in the wall socket. It's not a huge problem because this charger is going to stay at home and for travel will carry a universal mobile charger. Fast charging is also super useful for traveling.4. The keyboard is top-notch. The main reason I chose the 14-inch version over the 13-inch is because of the more spacious keyboard. Again essential for a work laptop if you don't want strained fingers. There are 3 levels of white backlighting and the touchpad is classic Zenbook - big, wide and feels premium. I don't use the integrated number pad too often but when I do it works well.5. Sound - Good enough to watch a movie or take a call in a quiet room and that's all I need. I use Bluetooth headphones/speakers at other times so the lack of a headphone jack doesn't bother me. Asus does include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, so that's great! The speakers are reasonable for an ultrabook so I am happy with the performance. They are not dismal like you will see on Vivobook X403 for example.6. Fan speed - this may not be a huge deal for most people but I absolutely needed a quiet laptop. I was spoilt by the 2016 version and the 2020 Zenbook doesn't disappoint. The fan is mostly quiet for 80% of the workday and spins up only when you are doing any demanding installs, editing etc. I tried a Yoga 640 and damn that thing was noisy as hell!7. Webcam - fine for doing work calls but is pretty average quality. At least it's in the right spot and the mics are high quality.8. Color - I would have preferred the silver color but Asus only offers this Pine Grey color in the 14-inch version. I wasn't willing to make that trade-off because the keyboard is slightly more cramped on the 13-incher. It's a premium looking color but silver does look more premium on an ultrabook.That's all! I'm very happy with my upgrade after 3 weeks of use. Asus also offers an 1 year extended warranty (total 2 years) for $20 so that's useful.I tried a Lenovo Yoga in June and was sorely disappointed. The build quality was average, the fan was damn noisy, battery life was unpredictable, the ports were a disaster (no thunderbolt, no charging, no HDMI) and I received a faulty screen from Lenovo.com.Asus Zenbooks have MUCH higher quality specially for professional use so I am never buying or recommending LENOVO if you are spending more than 60K on a laptop.I was finally happy to let my old Zenbook go for this new model! It's almost perfect.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I use it like a phone. Charge it at night and use it for the entire day! Charges very quickly in under an hour.Performance wise there's obviously no complaints. Its more than enough for most of the people doing serious work. Its incredibly fast. Face unlock works well. Screen is absolutely amazing. Its incredibly lightweight. Speakers are the loudest and clearest that I have ever heard on a laptop.Webcam quality is surprisingly good considering this is a laptop! Its comparable to macbooks.You get manual control of fan (kind of). Laptop can get warm if you are working and fast charging at the same time but you can set fan performance to max and it really helps with the cooling.I don't think any other product is available at this price with these specific features in India. Just go for this one.PS- before buying this, I had an asus Vivobook 14. loved it and used it for a long time. Had no problem.

I use my laptop for moderate load, photoshop, Autodesk sketchbook, streaming, a bit of CS:GO and it holds pretty great thanks to the 16gb ram.Pro's:*The secondary display (Huge benifit for me as I am into digital art as well)*Battery life : easily more than 10hrs for me with continuous streaming even when using both displays.*Screen : pantone validated screen is really gorgeous and it has a matte finish to control reflections.*Performance: holds up with almost anything I throw at it thanks to the 16gb ram and 10th gen i7 however if you are looking for heavy duty work like intense video editing, etc I would rather go for the pro version because the dedicated graphics in this one (Nvidia MX 250) is close to the intel integrated graphics and nothing more.Cons:*Thermal performance: no wonder here. The laptop is quite poor in thermals even though there is a hinge mechanism that lifts up the keyboard but not alarmingly poor, you could throw a cooler under and that should be fine.*Software: after the latest windows update there is an increase in BSOD(blue screen of death) glitches. The software might lag or glitch when using the secondary display(doesn't interfere that much but still noticable)The asus pen that comes with the laptop is also great.Overall I would say this is a perfect laptop if you go through light to moderate work loads and require two displays on the go.Ps.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I purchased the Asus Zenbook Flip S UX371EA laptop as a replacement for my three-year-old Microsoft Surface Book. I have been using this laptop for two weeks now, and here are my observations.Pros• Premium looks and build quality – Design and build quality is stunning, and it’s one of the most portable windows device I have used, even lighter than the Microsoft Surface Book. The rose gold touch to edges adds that slick look to the overall ‘Jade Black.’ colour profile of the laptop. The ergo lift hinge mechanism feels sturdy, and thankfully the screen does not wobble.• Display - I got this laptop purely for the 4K OLED display, as I would be using it more for photography editing and occasional full HD and 4K video editing. After getting used to the pixel sense display on MS surface book, it was difficult for me to go back to using a full HD laptop for image editing; there are minimal options for laptops with 4K screens - HP Spectre x360 - 13-aw0188tu matches the specs but costs up to INR 1.84 Lakhs, the next best option is Dell XPS 2-in-1 9000 series which also costs above INR 1.90 LakhsScreen brightness is suitable for indoor and outdoor work; you need to tweak the visual profile from display settings and the MyAsus app to lower the saturation levels. The color grading as the red shade may look too vivid, and the blacks too deep while watching 4K content.• The keyboard layout is comfortable, and the keys feel plush to type on. I haven’t felt any finger fatigue, and keyboard clacking noise is considerably less. The trackpad is wide to house a digital numeric keypad activated with one touch and offers two brightness levels. I am not going to use this feature much, and hence I find the wide keypad a bit of an irritant to my regular typing speed despite having a useful palm rejection feature.• I wanted to buy a laptop with an AMD Ryzen processor. Still, with the other specs combined, there are no other laptops from any manufacturer with a 4K screen, 16GB RAM, and 1TB SSD available in India. So I had decided to go with the latest Intel processor variant – 11th Gen i7 and WiFi 6 enabled. I did notice that the internet browsing speeds are much better. When I stream games from my Xbox series X, I do not see much lag on a 5Ghz connection.I use Luminar 4 and Luminar AI to edit images, and DaVinci Resolve to edit videos; these applications run without any noticeable performance issues, exporting an edited video does take more time than my iPad mini, I am yet to test 360 image and video editing on the Insta360 STUDIO 2021 software.Installed Cricket 19 game from Steam runs smoothly between 30-50 FPS with most in-game settings cranked to high levels, it does not support crowd rendering in any mode. I have to play with the crowd option turned off, don’t push your luck much with gaming on this laptop as the onboard Intel Iris XE GPU has its limitations, more with this laptop, to be precise.• Sound quality from the down-firing speakers on the Zenbook Flip S is decent for a 13-inch laptop; Sound output has an acceptable bass level without the need to use any sound enhancing software. The laptop comes equipped with a Realtek sound console app which can be used to configure equalizer for sound settingsYou get a high-quality leather sleeve for the laptop with good cushioning inside; A stylus has been provided, which is useful for my general image retouching while editing. I am not going to use it for extensive artwork in tablet mode. An additional USB-A port would have been useful for me on this laptop. I will not miss the 3.5mm headphone jack; two Thunderbolt USB-C ports help with high-speed data transfers and can be used to slow charge with any power bank.Cons• Battery life – I am observing the battery backup on this laptop as I write this review, and I have my doubts about the power management. I am not getting beyond 5-6 hours with display set to 4K, and I know Windows 10 battery health meter is not a reliable measure to track battery performance. Still, it drops at a steady rate even when I am not doing processor-intensive tasks. I need to run additional tests with the display setting on FHD when I don’t need the 4K display option.• Temperature Control – I have the Speccy app, which provides real-time CPU temperatures; while writing this review on MS Word and Spotify running in the background with a laptop placed on a raised stand, temperature readings were in the range of 50 – 60 degrees celcius. You can control the fan speeds from the MyAsus App. The fans run loud sometimes while running system-heavy background tasks with the laptop getting too hot near the raised hinge area on the back. I removed the McAfee anti-virus real-time scan software to check battery usage impact and fans running on full blow when this software performed a full system scan in the background.• Windows 10 – Windows as a platform for desktop/laptop is devolving rather than improving; this could be my last Windows laptop as I would go for an Apple Mac in the future. The Pinterest app downloaded from the Windows store does not work. The Flipboard app has text scaling. UI issues, Flipbook S laptop came with a DTS Sound processing app which only worked once, and it has not been updated since 2018 on the Windows app store. I was using the Font Candy paid app on my previous laptop, it has been pulled down as the developer shut shop; it seems, at least I need to have access to the app I paid for!If you are looking for a premium 2 in 1 windows laptop, Asus does not disappoint with all the bells and whistles. I did stretch my budget a bit to buy this laptop. Else I would have gone for a laptop with a dedicated GPU and AMD Ryzen processor, FHD screen. I had read articles and watched online reviews for Asus Zenbook Flip S UX371; it does not perform so well with competition on benchmark scores having the same specs - Intel Core i7-1165G7 and Intel Iris XE graphics. I am not the one who pays much attention to these numbers, and real-life performance matters to me.4K screen was a deal-breaker for me; hence I have chosen to stick with this laptop for another three years or so unless the battery springs up an unwanted surprise which I am monitoring\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Build quality is amazing. Feels premium in hand. Looks premium as well. I sawsome reviews online and they all complained about the glossy screen.but the unit I got had matte screen. Talking of screen. It's very good.covers almost 100% srgb color gamut. Can be used for professional color related work. Battery lifegood. Especially paired with the lenovo vantage software whichis really useful. Keyboard is good. The face recognition is spot on. Works even in the dark. Haven't tried it in pitch black yet. Now let's talk about performance. The ryzen 7 4800u is a beqst of a mobile processor. But it's a Shame this usnit is shipped with only 8 gigabyte of ram. Basically making the overpowered cpu useless in some memory intensive tasks. You can edit videos on this as well. But that 8 gb ram really ruins the experience. Really wish it was upgradable. Or at least 16 gb. But anyways,the SSD is fast and reliable. And also i've heard that you can install a second ssd in ryzen version. Haven't checked myself whether this unit is upgradable or not but if running into storage problems you can always use external storage solutions. You won't feel the difference if you went with the ryzen 5 version of this laptop, which i guess isn't available on Amazon but it might be in the market. The price online of this unit is fine, not overpriced but i think if you buy offline you'll have more options to look for cuz this laptop has aome other versions as well. And if you are thinking of buying this you can it really has no major problems except that little 8gb ram. But you may also consider the hp envy x360. It has ryzen 5 with non upgradable 8 gb ram. Which i guess would be better for 8 gb. Cuz your 8gb ram will limit the performance in heavy tasks.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

I am getting over 14 hours of screen on time doing web browsing and watching videos.2. The processor is very powerful. The performance of this machine in 'battery saving' mode is almost 1.5 times that of similarly priced Intel i7 11 Gen counterparts running on 'Extreme Performance' modes. And it limits CPU power to just 10 W in battery saving mode, which means that the fans never come on during daily usage like browsing the web or watching videos and runs cool.3. Windows Hello login using the IR camera makes logging in super easy and convenient. You can even set it up to lock itself, when you are not in front of the laptop for some time. The device can sense movements using the ToF camera and wakes itself up once you are around.4. USB C charging.5. Good Speakers. I have watched a couple of movies on the speakers. Did not feel the need to use my Bluetooth speakers as the inbuilt ones are loud enough.6. Display is color accurate, not that it matters for most people including me. It is a glossy panel, but I haven't had issues in the limited time I used it outdoors as the Ambient Light Sensor dials up brightness to max as soon as I step outdoors.7. Comes with 3 Year Warranty; most competing products even from Lenovo offer only a year. Be sure to check warranty time period once you get the laptop as mine came with 2 months less (34 months instead of 36 months) as Lenovo enters the date of purchase as the date of shipping by default.8. Superfast RAM. The soldered RAM is dual channel LPDDR4x running at a blazing fast 4266 Mhz.Cons1. Below average webcam quality; you will be better off with an external one.2. Intel 11th Gen laptops get Thunderbolt 4 ports that offer 40 Gbps speeds. But the ports selection here is not bad at all. The USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports offer 10 Gbps and the HDMI 2.0b can easily output to a 4k 60Hz monitor.3. Only 8 GB of RAM and not upgradable; but I have had no issues in a month's use.4. The trackpads are not as large as those found on Macbooks, but are a decent size, use Windows Precision drivers and are  accurate.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Short review - An excellent portable laptop from HP with superior tablet and laptop support 2 in 1. Great B&O speakers, sturdy hinges, decent screen, great battery life and a full size keyboard and trackpad. Must buy!Long review - So I have a hi-spec desktop at my office which I use primarily for all intensive jobs like video editing, photo editing, gaming, etc. I was using an iPad Air at home since the past 10 years. I was done with Apple and wanted to switch. I read about Chromebooks online and was immediately interested in purchasing one.After doing some research I came across the HP line of Chromebooks. My budget was around 30k which was the price for a new iPad. After seeing a number of reviews and work around videos for the Chrome OS, I shortlisted the HP line. I found the x360 and there were two options available a 12 inch convertible or a 14 inch laptop. The 12 inch made sense to me as I was looking at a tablet style PC. It perfectly fit my budget and I bought it in a flash.Received delivery from Amazon in one day which is as usual perfectly packed and on time as always.Unboxing it was a delight and I was in love at first sight. Extremely sleek and stylish and I was logged into Chrome OS and ready to go within a few clicks. The speakers from B&O are a delight and the screen is decent for its price. Can't expect a 1080p or 4K at 30k. The keyboard is extremely comfortable and so was the trackpad.A huge number of ports available and the USB C charging is a breeze. I use my OnePlus 7T Pro Warp charging cable to charge the X360. There is a stylus pen available from HPs website for 3.5k but I don't see myself using it so I didn't puchase it.Twist the screen and it becomes a tablet! No accidental tocuhes and a great quality touch makes using this a delight. YouTube, play store apps, browsing, doodling, zoom calls, all available at your disposal.I really don't have any cons at this moment but if I really have to be picky, I would want a better display but I know a higher screen resolution would mean lesser battery life.If anyone is looking at doing basic tasks on their laptop and have a budget of 30k I would strongly suggest Chrome OS and Hp x360. If you are looking at a tablet and laptop experience together, go for this model or then choose the 14inch which is 5k cheaper but it's only a laptop.Chrome OS is extremely easy to get used to and there are tons of videos online to take you through it.Thanks HP and chrome OS for finally helping me to get rid of the useless iPad. Goodbye Apple.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

Fast chip, ample I/O connections (almost future ready except for a proper thunderbolt 3 standard port), Dell active pen works with 4-5% flaw, i.e, 4-5 tiny smudges here and there are unavoidable in real life applications like online teaching.It’s good value for money choice for commoners as Dell (which used to be synonymous with common man’s pc) has now found greener pastures in Inspiron, XPS and Precision series in or above  1-1.5 lakh range.For elderly like us, if you are happy with specs and price range I would still say ‘go ahead and buy it because it’s Dell’ in comparison to some of the other brands which might save another 10-15K. And, a final piece of advice: Don’t go for the i3 model if you want smooth experience of Whiteboard with Dell active pen.Final verdict: About 5-10K overpriced for a product like this but this is one of the few dependable choices in the market with these specs.\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Ordered this a little more than a week ago during the festival sale. I ve used many Xiaomi devices so even though laptops were a new territory for Xiaomi (at least from an Indian market standpoint), despite mixed reviews I thought why not give it a try considering the price to value ratio, all the while knowing that should it give me any issues I can always return it.From day one, the laptop gave me issues :1) mousepad stopped working2) usb cam does not get recognised 50 per cent of the time3) the mic is not recognised in online meetings 50 per cent of the time. Only solution is to end meeting and rejoin.4) browser hung on day 1 without multiple tabs opened.I gave it a few days but the issues were consistent and therefore I called Amazon within the stipulated deadline, to return the product as I had lost trust in Xiaomi as a laptop brand and wanted to invest in an established brand like dell,hp.First, Amazon have kept specific windows now to get hold of their team for returns 8am-12. 12am to 1. I kept an alarm so that I don\\'t miss the second slot, as because of my shift time the first one is not possible. The rep. told me to my shock that returns are not possible anymore on electronics and I should have a technician visit and fix the issue. I told him I\\'m not a person who can afford to keep switching laptops and hence I intend to invest in a laptop which doesn\\'t run into issues as I will keep it for 8-10 years. The rep. transferred the call to the manager. He repeated the samething, dealers complain to us so we changed policy. I asked them to check my purchase history, I ve been a regular customer with expensive purchases like washing machine, multiple flagship phones etc. which I have never returned. So I told them that I can understand if you say this to a habitual offender but not me.Then he said they can\\'t see \"what options will be \" available until a technician visit happens. The other option was an online test. Since I work in shifts, I said I prefer an online test to which I was told there was no option for manager to transfer call and also the tech team didn\\'t work at this time. I told him what\\'s the point of having a specific slot for return calls when the relevant team doesnt function at the time.After a lengthy conversation, I wasn\\'t left with any option but to book a technician visit. Looks like they re going to force me to stay with this laptop but I feel very cheated as I never used to consider any other e commerce company due to Amazon s customer first policy, but when it was really my turn to experience it, this is what I got.I even said I\\'m fine with credit of my money as Amazon balance for future purchases so that I can buy a laptop of my choice. This will give dealer s confidence to sell faulty products. Most importantly a loyal customer lost is a loss of free word of mouth publicity and there\\'s no data on how many people that he/she shares their experience with. It all adds up. Hope Amazon wakes up sooner than later and starts respecting it\\'s customers again (at least ones who have a clean history).\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Here are a few points which are not mentioned anywhere else. Not necessarily drawbacks but good to know:1. The Active pen doesn't come with extra tips. Highly recommend a DIY cap to protect the tip from falls. Also the pen runs on a single AAAA battery.2. The keyboard letters are not visible when sitting under a light bulb. (see pic) But the letter and function buttons layout is great. Fingerprint scanner is under the keyboard unlike HP Envy x360.3. The display is bright enough for indoor use and colors feel little on warmer side. Many articles on the web are criticizing this display not being bright enough but it is sufficient.4. The charger is humongous, bigger than the MacBook one (see pic)5. When lid is closed, I think it attaches like a magnet cuz it's not that easy to get it to open. The initial one centimeter feels bit tight. After that we can open with one finger.6. Like every other laptop, it's made in China.7. It comes pre-installed with lifetime validity of MS Office Home 2019 i.e. Only Word, Excel, PowerPoint. Gotta pay for the others if you want.8. It comes with Wi-Fi 5, but it's easily upgradable to Wi-Fi 6 in future. You don't need Wi-Fi 6 adapter unless you have a compatible Wi-Fi 6 router.9. 8GB Ram is soldered on. Can't be upgraded.

Didn’t test outdoors. Colour accuracy is not the worst but avg.External monitor is necessary for those who are much concerned abt colour reproduction. Touch works fine. Lenovo active pen is added bonus.Quite useful for writing in one note . But if ur purpose is to write notes or draw iPad pro and apple pencil are the best in market.Battery life : Definitely not 10 hrs as claimed by Lenovo. Web browsing,mails,youtube and other media consumption got me 7.5-8 hrs .65w charger with barrel pin ( no type c charger in India ) charges laptop quite fast. No heating issueSpeakers: front facing speakers are crisp and loud but distort at 100% volume.Ports: Hdmi, 2 Usb 3.1 , 1 type c , 1 headphone jack. I tried charging with my 50w realme x2 pro type c charger but it didn’t charge.Fingerprint scanner :5/5Very fast and accurateSpeed and performance: Ryzen 4500U does everything u throw at it. Don’t expect 4k video rendering and graphic intensive games at high frame rate as vega 8 gpu is integrated one.If gaming is ur priority buy Hp pavilion gaming for 60k launched with this on prime dayKeyboard: It’s a personal preference coz some like less travel distance btw keys and some like moreBut I liked it. Good responsive trackpad . It’s backlit with 2 levels of lighting.Preloaded software : Ms office and student 2019Camera: 0.9 mp 720p camera with privacy shutter. Does the job for videocalls.Final thoughts:Things i liked - look and feel , speed and performance,touch screen,no need to press power button everytime it turns on just by opening,fast read and write speeds.battery life.Things i didn’t like :slightly less brighter screen, Bluetooth 4.2 , No Type C charger in box,minor flex on pressure as it is completely made of plastic.Pricing should be 5k less to make it more vfm. i.e 52k is ideal ( I feel so )Wifi 6 is futureproof but here we get wifi 5 only. But It can be replaced. Long term durability should be tested coz it’s completely made of plastic.Well this concludes my initial review. Hope this helps.

It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.Pros:- 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels- Intel Core i7 (10th generation)- 512GB NVMe SSD- Nvidia GeForce MX350- 1.35kg- Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work)- Premium looks- Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though)- Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travelCons:- No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime- Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bassThe laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Ordered this a little more than a week ago during the festival sale. I ve used many Xiaomi devices so even though laptops were a new territory for Xiaomi (at least from an Indian market standpoint), despite mixed reviews I thought why not give it a try considering the price to value ratio, all the while knowing that should it give me any issues I can always return it.From day one, the laptop gave me issues :1) mousepad stopped working2) usb cam does not get recognised 50 per cent of the time3) the mic is not recognised in online meetings 50 per cent of the time. Only solution is to end meeting and rejoin.4) browser hung on day 1 without multiple tabs opened.I gave it a few days but the issues were consistent and therefore I called Amazon within the stipulated deadline, to return the product as I had lost trust in Xiaomi as a laptop brand and wanted to invest in an established brand like dell,hp.First, Amazon have kept specific windows now to get hold of their team for returns 8am-12. 12am to 1. I kept an alarm so that I don\\'t miss the second slot, as because of my shift time the first one is not possible. The rep. told me to my shock that returns are not possible anymore on electronics and I should have a technician visit and fix the issue. I told him I\\'m not a person who can afford to keep switching laptops and hence I intend to invest in a laptop which doesn\\'t run into issues as I will keep it for 8-10 years. The rep. transferred the call to the manager. He repeated the samething, dealers complain to us so we changed policy. I asked them to check my purchase history, I ve been a regular customer with expensive purchases like washing machine, multiple flagship phones etc. which I have never returned. So I told them that I can understand if you say this to a habitual offender but not me.Then he said they can\\'t see \"what options will be \" available until a technician visit happens. The other option was an online test. Since I work in shifts, I said I prefer an online test to which I was told there was no option for manager to transfer call and also the tech team didn\\'t work at this time. I told him what\\'s the point of having a specific slot for return calls when the relevant team doesnt function at the time.After a lengthy conversation, I wasn\\'t left with any option but to book a technician visit. Looks like they re going to force me to stay with this laptop but I feel very cheated as I never used to consider any other e commerce company due to Amazon s customer first policy, but when it was really my turn to experience it, this is what I got.I even said I\\'m fine with credit of my money as Amazon balance for future purchases so that I can buy a laptop of my choice. This will give dealer s confidence to sell faulty products. Most importantly a loyal customer lost is a loss of free word of mouth publicity and there\\'s no data on how many people that he/she shares their experience with. It all adds up. Hope Amazon wakes up sooner than later and starts respecting it\\'s customers again (at least ones who have a clean history).\\n\\n  \\nRead more',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Do not buy this laptop from here. They are trying to get rid of their faulty stock. Read in another review that the person got faulty machine and he got a replacement. Thought it might be a one off. I was also sent a faulty laptop when I ordered...pixels were not lighting up properly in a spot. I was able  to apply for a replacement but they messed up the details of the laptop they were picking up from me. I spent about an hour with the delivery person trying to resolve it, with him on his phone talking to his Amazon contacts and me on my phone with Amazon customer care but they were not able to fix it. So be prepared for the replacement to be delayed as well, when you get the faulty laptop. Also, if you paid extra for one/same day delivery, it is not refunded in case you have to return the laptop. So you pay extra money and still can't use the laptop as soon as you expected it to.The replacement they gave me was also faulty...one of the letters in the logo on the back of the screen was missing(the glue came off or wasn't stuck there properly during manufacturing). So again talked to customer care about this. They said they can refund my money but not fix the machine or replace it(replacement limit is one).So you will have to buy the laptop again if you get a faulty machine as replacement and no guarantee that second time you order, you won't get a faulty machine. This is because they might send you someone else's rejected machine or one from their faulty stock where they have not even done basic quality checks like looking for visible exterior damage or screen issues. This is something they definitely check for, if you are exchanging your old phone/laptop/other electronics.I am going to try to use the Lenovo warranty to get the issue fixed and hoping some other issues don't pop up.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After one month, I wrote this review because I was bored and had nothing more important to do.My laptop's exact name and model number are Asus Vivobook S S14 S433EA-AM501TS. (I Don't know why but Amazon shows reviews of a lot of different models on the same page)PROS:1. The Laptop is really lightweight and sleek. The laptop's exact weight is 1.4 kg, 10 grams lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 inch, which my friend has.2. The screen is 60hz and excellent and does not flex. My unit did not have any light bleeding too.3. The keyboard is clicky and responsive. The backlight is fairly bright too, you will not get any problems typing in the dark. (other than weak eyesight lol)4. The body is of an aluminum alloy that feels pleasant to the touch. The hinge is also very sturdy and stable.5. Palm rest is excellent too. Typing on this keyboard is very comfortable.6. The trackpad has windows precision drivers, so you'll have more accurate clicks and smoother gestures.7. The fingerprint scanner is stupidly accurate. Even the smallest particle of dust on your finger will not let you log in to your pc, which is good for privacy, but sometimes it is just annoying, lol.8. The i5-1135G7 Cpu, along with Iris Xe G7 80EU Gpu, makes this machine fast. I only play the game Valorant on my laptop, and it easily and consistently gives 100-150 frames on it. (You can only see 60 frames per second(Fps) as the laptop screen is 60hz, but it is recommended to have more than 60 frames per second as the frames always keep fluctuating)9. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port(sometimes amazon webpage glitches and shows Thunderbolt 3, but I've double-checked, and it is indeed Thunderbolt 4). You can charge your laptop with any type C charger.10. The laptop boots up in 8 seconds, which is just pure bliss. After clicking power button, you can be on your chrome tab in just 11 seconds. NVMe PCIe SSD makes everything snappy. Also, the storage is expandable too.11. The laptop has 32 Gb intel optane memory. To be honest, I don't know how I can review that, but with the help of thorough research on google and a friend who is a bigger nerd than me, I can say that optane memory memorizes the pattern of the applications you use and when you use them, and then, prepares everything in advance so than everything is snappier and smooth. Even though I really don't know how I can test it, I would rather choose to have it than not to have it.12. The Webcam is 720p and It is not good nor bad. You will be good for your zoom and google meets.13. The stock MY ASUS app is handy. The best thing is that you can set the maximum limit for the charge capacity to 60%, 80%, or 100%, improving battery health in the long term.CONS1. Although the Ram is 3200Mhz (which is arguably the fastest in laptops), it is soldered onto the motherboard, meaning you cannot upgrade your ram, ever, which sucks horribly. If I had to, I would always pick ram expansion over storage expansion.2. The battery is excellent but does not last 12 hours as advertised, even in a medium to low usage scenario.3. That yellow enter key is just ugly (It is subjective). I don't understand why Asus added that color in a clean ultrabook like this.4. You can only add one fingerprint in windows hello support. (Although you can do a hack by using different fingers while setting up the fingerprint lock)5. The Stickers below the keyboard were terribly placed and weren't aligned at all, which triggered my OCD. I removed them the day I got the laptop in my hands.CONCLUSIONIf any con mentioned above is not a dealbreaker for you, I will definitely recommend you to go for this laptop, considering that the competition like Acer is offering the same for 10k rupees more.P.S. –Bear in mind that the pictures I have attached with my review are clicked after 1 month of usage, so they will contain fingerprints as I have very sweaty hands and a little bit of dust as my room has a lot of sunlight.And of course, if I find anything else worth mentioning, I will edit this review.Good luck with your Laptop buying journey.Hope I helped :)\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  After a rather blissful unboxing experience (ASUS provided some fun stickers in the box) and a 3-hour charge before switching on the laptop on battery mode (as recommended by Asus), the laptop managed to boot up pretty quickly after the initial setup.

The previous laptop I used had a TN panel which is terrible when it comes to both colours and viewing angles and this laptop provided a breath of fresh air to my usage experience.Processor and Performance:The laptop is powered by the i5-1135G7 which is an 11th gen processor. Daily tasks are snappy and quick, thanks to the 512 GB SSD as well as the Intel Optane memory. The laptop also handles high-productivity apps like Lightworks and Blender well. The laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM but it's unfortunately not user-upgradable... huge, huge bummer.The processor also packs in Intel Iris Xe graphics which is good enough for playing esports titles in medium graphics. I play rocket league often and the laptop handles it smoothly (with some heating though) at quality settings with an average of 50 - 60 fps. Don't buy the laptop if you want to run AAA titles in high settings, this is not the laptop for that.Ports and connectivity:The laptop has a good assortment of ports, exempting a RJ-45 ethernet port and a full sized SD Card reader (the reader in the laptop is for micro SD). The Thunderbolt 4 port in the laptop was one of the main features which attracted me as a buyer. It offers 40 gbps of transmission speeds and it also supports display and power delivery. It also has some unique features like eGPU support and a host of other accessories that can truly improve your laptop's performance (note that these accessories come with a hefty price). There are the usual USB A x3, HDMI and audio/mic jack. On a side note, the lack of ports can always be fulfilled by using adapters, and since Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible, any adapter connected to it will work at it's highest possible transmission speed.Battery and Thermals:The laptop claims to have 12 hours of battery life and ASUS has provided a lot of software optimizations (myASUS app) to achieve this. However, you can't achieve 12 hours unless the laptop is set in 'whisper mode' and only used for light tasks. Running heavy productivity apps, streaming videos, and playing games can drain the battery faster and the battery on average usage lasts up to 6 - 8 hours. The thermals however aren't great. Running heavy apps and games can heat the laptop to a good extent and while it's not extremely hot, it's certainly not comfortable to use the keyboard, let alone keep it on your lap. Moreover, the fan can be a bit loud while on performance mode, however, it's a trade-off for lesser heat.Other stuff:The trackpad is nice and accurate, it supports Windows gestures which makes switching through apps, and the general usage of the laptop very smooth and intuitive. The webcam is pretty basic and should suffice for meetings and video calls. The myASUS app has a host of features like different battery modes, limited charging for prolonged times, AI noise cancellation in mics, etc which can be really useful. The keyboard is comfortable to use, with nice key travel, except for a few oddly positioned keys. Backlighting for the keyboard is alright, and I find no point in using it unless in very dimly lit places, and it does its job in those conditions. The build quality is great, and the laptop has a premium look and finish. The fingerprint sensor is fairly accurate and responsive.  Finally, Office Home & Student 2019 comes pre-installed so that's always an upside.Overall consensus:The laptop should be a good enough daily driver for pretty much anyone. The good combination of a snappy processor, decent integrated graphics, fast SSD storage and the Optane memory as a garnish makes it a champ in productivity.  At the current price of the laptop (Rs. 60,990), it offers many features (Thunderbolt 4, Optane Memory, 100% sRGB) that other brands offer with at least Rs. 5000 - 10000 hike.\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  Review - #1, On 13-Feb-2021Good laptop for the given configuration and price. I was little worried because i'm moving from AirBook to this once, the moment i got this laptop build quality seemed to be good, but yes coming from Mac this might not match the expectation.Pros1. OS Booting time is under 6S, Thanks to Optane, Seems to be helping to boot faster2. Super Sleek Design and metal body gives nice grip on the laptop3. Display is doing good, but not that great (Caution : I'm used to Mac Display)4. IDEs like Eclipse, Intelli J, PyCharms seems to be opening faster, Office is activated and opening faster5. Docker, Ubuntu WSL is performing well too6. Headphone audio quality is good7. Finger print is working fine, tested with my 8 old kid's :)Cons1. Lan Port (RJ45) jack is missing (I knew it when i'm buying)2. At times, Wifi is loosing the signal strength (Would test with 5GHz Router)3. Built-in Speakers are not that loud enough, but the headphone quality is so good4. At times, keyboard backlight is not useful :(Keyboard layout is little clumsy( may be the problem is with me because i use Mac and Dell Latitude for Office work)Further evaluation to be done areAt this moment i don't have better internet connectivity, would test with 500Mbps line laterI haven't tried the thunderbolt port yetDual Boot :)Phone mirroring :)Battery Life\\n\\n  \\nRead more\",\n",
